DocETL is a tool for creating and executing data processing pipelines, especially suited for complex document processing tasks. It offers:

1. An interactive UI playground for iterative prompt engineering and pipeline development
2. A Python package for running production pipelines from the command line or Python code

## üöÄ Getting Started

There are two main ways to use DocETL:

### 1. üéÆ DocWrangler, the Interactive UI Playground (Recommended for Development)

[DocWrangler](https://docetl.org/playground) helps you iteratively develop your pipeline:
- Experiment with different prompts and see results in real-time
- Build your pipeline step by step
- Export your finalized pipeline configuration for production use

![DocWrangler](docs/assets/tutorial/one-operation.png)

DocWrangler is hosted at [docetl.org/playground](https://docetl.org/playground). But to run the playground locally, you can either:
- Use Docker (recommended for quick start): `make docker`
- Set up the development environment manually

See the [Playground Setup Guide](https://ucbepic.github.io/docetl/playground/) for detailed instructions.

### 2. üì¶ Python Package (For Production Use)

If you want to use DocETL as a Python package:

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or later
- OpenAI API key

```bash
pip install docetl
```

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Required for LLM operations (or the key for the LLM of your choice)
```

To see examples of how to use DocETL, check out the [tutorial](https://ucbepic.github.io/docetl/tutorial/).

### 2. üéÆ DocWrangler Setup

To run DocWrangler locally, you have two options:

#### Option A: Using Docker (Recommended for Quick Start)

The easiest way to get the DocWrangler playground running:

1. Create the required environment files:

Create `.env` in the root directory:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BACKEND_ALLOW_ORIGINS=
BACKEND_HOST=0.0.0.0
BACKEND_PORT=8000
BACKEND_RELOAD=True
FRONTEND_HOST=0.0.0.0
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
```

Create `.env.local` in the `website` directory:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini

NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_HOST=localhost
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_PORT=8000
```

2. Run Docker:
```bash
make docker
```

This will:
- Create a Docker volume for persistent data
- Build the DocETL image
- Run the container with the UI accessible at http://localhost:3000

To clean up Docker resources (note that this will delete the Docker volume):
```bash
make docker-clean
```

#### Option B: Manual Setup (Development)

For development or if you prefer not to use Docker:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucbepic/docetl.git
cd docetl
```

2. Set up environment variables in `.env` in the root/top-level directory:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BACKEND_ALLOW_ORIGINS=
BACKEND_HOST=localhost
BACKEND_PORT=8000
BACKEND_RELOAD=True
FRONTEND_HOST=0.0.0.0
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
```

And create an .env.local file in the `website` directory with the following:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini

NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_HOST=localhost
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_PORT=8000
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
make install      # Install Python package
make install-ui   # Install UI dependencies
```

Note that the OpenAI API key, base, and model name are for the UI assistant only; not the DocETL pipeline execution engine.

4. Start the development server:
```bash
make run-ui-dev
```

5. Visit http://localhost:3000/playground to access the interactive UI.

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

If you're planning to contribute or modify DocETL, you can verify your setup by running the test suite:

```bash
make tests-basic  # Runs basic test suite (costs < $0.01 with OpenAI)
```
