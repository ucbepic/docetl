A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.

Google may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Distributor if: (a) Distributor  breaches Clause 2 (License Grants and Restrictions), Clause 3.6 (EULA), Clause 3.7 (Accurate Reproduction), or Clause 6 (Confidential  Information), (b) if Google believes, in good faith, that the Distributor has violated or caused Google to violate any Anti-Bribery Laws (as  defined in Clause 8.5) or that such a violation is reasonably likely to occur, or (c) Distributor is in material breach of this Agreement more  than [ * ] notwithstanding any cure of such breaches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that the government or  controlling body of any country or territory in which Bundles are distributed imposes any law, restriction or regulation that makes it illegal  to distribute the Products, or any portion of them, into such country or territory, or if any such law, restriction or regulation places a  substantial burden on Google, where substantial is measured with respect to Google's economic benefit under this Agreement, as  determined by Google in its reasonable and good faith judgment (such substantial burden, a \"Substantial Burden\") then either party or  Google (in the case of a Substantial Burden) may require the suspension of all distributions of Bundles in such country or territory until  such time as such law, restriction or regulation is repealed, nullified or modified such that it is no longer illegal or a Substantial Burden (in  the case of Google), as applicable, for Bundles to be distributed in such country or territory (\"Special Suspension\"); provided, however,  that Distributor's obligations under Clause 3.5 (Exclusivity) shall not apply in respect of the relevant country or territory during any  period of Special Suspension. If a period of Special Suspension extends for more than [ * ] may then terminate this Agreement (in part) in  respect of the affected country or territory only, such termination to take effect upon written notice[ * ].

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement: (a) all rights and licenses granted under this Agreement shall  immediately cease; (b) Distributor shall (and shall ensure that any Third Party Distributors shall) immediately stop reproducing the  Products and offering or distributing Bundles; (c) Distributor shall return or destroy (and a duly appointed officer of Distributor shall  certify to such destruction) all copies of the Products and any other Google Confidential Information in its possession; and (d) the fees  payable to Distributor shall immediately cease accruing and Google shall within [ * ] following such expiration or termination pay to  Distributor any undisputed amounts which have accrued from the time of the most recent payment to Distributor through the date of  termination or expiration of this Agreement. Clauses 5.6 (Effect of Termination), 6 (Confidential Information), 7 (Proprietary Rights), 9  (Limitation of Liability), 10 (Indemnification) and 11 (General) shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n  - 8 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n6.

It does not include  information that the recipient already knew, that becomes public through no fault of the recipient, that was independently developed by  the recipient or that was lawfully given to the recipient by a third party.\n\n6.2 The recipient of any Confidential Information shall not disclose that Confidential Information, except to Group Companies, employees  and/or professional advisors who need to know it and who have agreed in writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise  bound) to keep it confidential. The recipient shall ensure that those people and entities: (a) use such Confidential Information only to  exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement, and (b) keep such Confidential Information confidential. The recipient may  also disclose Confidential Information when required by law, or the regulation or rule of a major US stock exchange or the United States  Securities and Exchange Commission, after giving reasonable notice to the discloser, such notice to be sufficient to give the discloser: (i)  the opportunity to seek confidential treatment, a protective order or similar remedies or relief prior to disclosure (if applicable) and (ii)  (where any disclosure is necessary) time to consult on and approve the form and content of the relevant disclosure. The parties shall then  promptly discuss and agree in good faith on the form and content of the disclosure (each acting reasonably).\n\n7.

Distributor must give  Google a reasonable time to fix the problem and (if necessary) to supply Distributor with a corrected or replacement version of the  Distribution Product or a way to work-around the problem that is not materially detrimental to Distributor, or to re-perform any relevant  services. This will be done without any additional charge to Distributor. If Google is able to do this within a reasonable time, Google will  have no other obligations or liability in relation to that breach.\n\n8.4 Google will not be liable for breach of any of the warranties or other terms in this Agreement to the extent that the breach arises from:\n\n  (a) use of the Products other than in accordance with normal operating procedures;\n\n  (b) any alterations or maintenance to the Products done by anyone other than Google or someone authorised by Google;\n\n  (c) any problem with a computer on which the Products are installed, or with any equipment connected to that computer or any  other software which is installed on that computer;\n\n  (d) any abnormal or incorrect operating conditions; or\n\n  (e) use of the Products in combination with any other hardware or software, unless this use has been approved by Google in  writing.\n\n8.5 Distributor will comply with all applicable commercial and public anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, the UK's Bribery Act  2010 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\"Anti-Bribery Laws\"), which prohibit (amongst other things) corrupt offers of  anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official to obtain or keep business. ''Government officials\" include any  government employee, candidate for public office, and employee of government-owned or government-controlled companies, public  international organisations, and political parties. Furthermore, Distributor will not make any facilitation payments, which are payments to  induce officials to perform routine functions they are otherwise obligated to perform.\n\n8.6 No conditions, warranties or other terms apply to the Products, [ * ] or to any other goods or services supplied under this Agreement  unless expressly set out in this Agreement. Subject to Clause 9.1, no implied conditions, warranties or other terms apply (including any  implied terms as to satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose or conformance with description).\n\n9.

If the amount referred to in (b) above cannot be calculated accurately at the time the relevant liability is to be  assessed (the \"Applicable Time\"), it shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis as X/Y x Z. Where:     X = the total sum paid and payable to the Distributor pursuant to Clause 4 in the relevant Contract Year prior to the Applicable Time;     Y = the number of days elapsed in the relevant Contract Year prior to the Applicable Time; and     Z = 365     *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (c) breach of any implied condition as to title or quiet enjoyment; and\n\n  (d) misuse of confidential information.\n\n9.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit either party's liability under Clause 10 (Indemnities), or Distributor's liability under Clause  2 (License Grants and Restrictions), Clause 3.5 (Exclusivity), Clause 3.6 (End User License Agreement) and Clause 3.7 (Accurate  Reproduction) or Clause [ * ].\n\n9.3 Subject to Clauses 9.1 and 9.2, neither party shall be liable under this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for any:\n\n  (a) loss of anticipated savings;\n\n  (b) loss of business opportunity (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not include loss of advertising revenue);\n\n  (c) loss of or corruption of data;\n\n  (d) loss or damage resulting from third party claims; or\n\n  (e) indirect or consequential losses;\n     suffered or incurred by the other party (whether or not such losses were within the contemplation of the parties at the date of this  Agreement).\n\n9.4 Subject to Clauses 9.1 and 9.2, each party's total liability under or in connection with this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or  otherwise) arising in any Contract Year is limited to the greater of:\n\n  (a) [ * ] Euros ([ * ] Euros); and\n\n  (b) [ * ]% of the total payment due to the Distributor in the relevant Contract Year pursuant to Clause 4 (Payment Terms).\n\n  - 11 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   By Distributor.\n\n   User claim arising out of or resulting from such End Users use of any Distributor App(s), including any actions or claims in product  liability, tort, contract or equity.     *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n10.

These practices include but are not limited to installing  software on computers without obtaining informed end user consent (the so-called \"drive-by download\"), inundating end users with  advertisements without adequate attribution or labeling, exposing users to pornographic material without obtaining informed end user consent,  obtaining or transmitting personal information about an end user without obtaining informed end user consent, and interfering with an end user's  ability to easily uninstall applications the end user does not wish to be on his or her computer.     Google does not wish to be associated with these types of practices. Accordingly, Google has developed the Guidelines set forth below to prevent  its trademark, other intellectual property, and services from being used in connection with these practices. Google believes that these Guidelines  are necessary to protect Google from any allegation that it has contributed to practices that might be viewed as unlawful or actionable; to preserve  the reputation of Google as a provider of trusted software and services in a manner that is beneficial and fair to users and other constituents; and  to stem the rising incidence of practices that harm users and diminish the perceived value and reliability of the internet, which are essential to  Google's business.     With this objective in mind, Google has established the following Guidelines to apply to customer Applications that are bundled with any Google  Application. Except to the extent Google has otherwise specifically agreed in writing, Google does not grant permission to, and you will not,  bundle any Application with a Google Application unless you ensure that any such Application specified in the agreement between you and  Google that incorporated these Guidelines complies with these Guidelines.     For the avoidance of doubt, by these Guidelines Google does not intend to, and does not, impose any restrictions on what you may do with any  Application that is not bundled with a Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google  services; you remain free to sell any Application you wish (whether or not it complies with these Guidelines) so long as it is not bundled with a  Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google services.     In these Guidelines: (a) \"you\" and \"your\" refer to the legal entity(ies) that has entered into the contract with Google into which these Guidelines  are incorporated, as well as any person or entity acting on your behalf; and (b) \"Application\" means any application, plug-in, helper, component or  other executable code that runs on a user's computer, examples of which include those that provide browser helper objects, instant messaging,  chat, email, data, file viewing, media playing, file sharing, games, internet navigation, search and other services.    Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  - 23 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google welcomes input about these Guidelines from you and from other interested parties, and is always willing to consider revisions as  appropriate to encourage innovation while protecting against deceptive, unfair and harmful practices. Accordingly, Google may update these  Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time as provided in Section 10 below.     If you have any questions about these Guidelines, please do not hesitate to discuss them with your Google account manager.     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  - 24 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   1. General.     1.1 Approval and Ongoing Compliance. You may bundle Google Applications with Applications only to the extent permitted in the  signed written agreement into which these Guidelines have been incorporated. In such instance, you must ensure that your Application both (1)  has been approved by Google for the purpose of being bundled with Google Applications in writing in advance, and (2) complies at all times with  the requirements outlined herein. To obtain Google's approval for any Applications not expressly approved in your agreement, you must submit a  written request.     1.2 No Google Branding or Attribution. Your Application, and any related collateral material (including any Web pages promoting your  Application or from which your Application is made available), must not contain any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then  only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing. In addition, queries entered into Applications may not resolve to a results page  that contains any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing.     2. Prohibited Content. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that: (a) contains any viruses, worms, trojan horses, or the  like; and (b) is distributed primarily for the purpose of (i) distributing pornographic, obscene, excessively profane, gambling-related, deceptive,  fraudulent or illegal content, or (ii) distributing content related to \"hacking\" or \"cracking.\"     3. Prohibited Behavior. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that engages in deceptive, unfair, harassing or otherwise  annoying practices. For example, the Application may not:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (a) use, or permit an unaffiliated person to use, an end user's computer system for any purpose not understood and  affirmatively consented to by the end user (including, without limitation, for purposes of consuming bandwidth or  computer resources, sending email messages, launching denial of service attacks, accruing toll charges through a dialer  or obtaining personal information from an end user's computer such as login, password, account or other information  personal to the end user);\n\n  (b) intentionally create or exploit any security vulnerabilities in end user computers;\n\n  (c) trigger pop-ups, pop-unders, exit windows, or similar obstructive or intrusive functionality, that materially interfere with  an end user's Web navigation or browsing or the use of his or her computer;\n\n  (d) repeatedly ask an end user to take, or try to deceive an end user into taking, an action that the end user has previously  declined to take (such as repeatedly asking an end user to change his or her home page or some other setting or  configuration);\n\n  - 25 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4. Disclosure and Consent.     4.1 Disclosure and Consent before Installation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless you (and your  distribution and bundling partners, if applicable under the terms of the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these Guidelines)  design the installation of any such Application in a manner that ensures that it is installed by end users in a knowing and willful manner - e.g., no  \"drive-by' downloads or installs. By \"distribution partner\" we mean any third party who distributes your Application and by \"bundling partner\"  we mean any third party who installs your Application in combination with or alongside one or more other Applications. At a minimum, compliance  with this provision requires that, prior to installing your Application, you and any third party distributing or bundling your Application:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4.2 Disclosure and Consent for Collection and Transmission of Personally Identifiable information. You may not bundle any Google  Application with any Application that (1) collects or transmits to any entity other than the end user personally identifiable information, or (2)  collects or transmits information related to a user's computer or Internet usage or activity in a manner that could collect or transmit such user's  personally identifiable information (such as through keystroke logging), unless prior to the first occurrence of any such collection or transmission  you:\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (e) redirect browser traffic away from valid DNS entries (except that your Application may direct unresolved URLs to an  alternative URL designated by you, provided that the page to which the end user resolves adequately informs the end  user that you and your Application are the source of that page);\n\n  (f) interfere with the browser default search functionality (except that your Application may permit an end user to change  his or her default search engine with proper disclosure, consent and attribution as provided below); or\n\n  (g) engage in activity that violates any applicable Jaw or regulation.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose to end users:\n\n  (i) that they are installing an application,\n\n  (ii) the name of the Application, identifying you as the entity responsible for it, and\n\n  (iii) the principal and significant features and functionality of the Application; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to install the Application.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose:\n\n  - 26 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4.3 Disclosure and Consent for Setting Changes. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that makes a  change to any operating system or Application data setting which will impact the user experience of other Applications (e.g., changing the  browser default home page or changing the default application for a file type, such as the default email, browser or media player application),  unless prior to making such change you:\n\n\n\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no disclosure and consent need be made for changes to operating system or Application data settings that  have only a minor impact on user experience, such as adding a small number of bookmarks to the browser menu or adding an item to a start menu,  and (ii) the disclosure and consent requirements of this Section 4.3 will not apply to those setting changes that may be made prior to sale to the  end user.     4.4 Method of Disclosure and Consent. In order to satisfy the requirements above, the disclosure of the items specified above (a) must be  provided in both (1) the End User License Agreement (EULA) or privacy policy (to the extent required by law or otherwise by industry custom)  and (2) separately from the EULA and/or privacy policy (e.g. in installation screens or message boxes, as the case may be), and (b) must be  designed so that it will be read by, adequately inform and evidence the consent of a typical Internet user. See Attachment 1 for sample disclosure  and consent implementations that would satisfy certain of the requirements above.     4.5 EULA and Privacy Policy. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless it conforms, and is distributed  pursuant to a EULA that conforms, with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, you and your Application must comply with the  agreements and representations you make with your end users in your EULA and privacy policy. Your privacy policy must be accessible from  your Application in an easily found location. If your Application collects or transmits any other information related to the user's use of his or her  computer, but not required to be disclosed and consented to pursuant to Section 4.2, then the collection and use of such other information must  be disclosed in your privacy policy.     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (i) the type of information collected (described with specificity in the case of personally identifiable information),\n\n  (ii) the method of collection (e.g. by registration, etc.), and\n\n  (iii) the location of (i.e., a link to) the privacy policy that governs the collection, use and disclosure of the  information; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to such collection and/or transmission.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose the change in a manner that will explain the practical effect of  such change; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to make such change.\n\n  - 27 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   5. Transparency. Neither you nor any of your third party distribution or bundling partners may mislead end users or create end user confusion  with regard to the source or owner of an Application or any portion of its purpose, functionality or features. For example, all elements of your  Application that are visible to the end user must clearly identify their source through its branding and attribution, and that identification, whatever  form it takes, must correspond to the identification of your application in the menu that permits end users to remove programs. You must clearly  label advertisements provided by your Application (if any) as such and clearly identify your Application as the source of those advertisements. In  addition, if your Application modifies the operation or display of other applications or Web sites (other than Web sites that you own), then in  each instance you must clearly and conspicuously attribute the source of that modification to your Application (as distinct from the application or  Web site modified) in a manner that will inform a typical Internet user; provided that this requirement will not apply to modifications for which you  obtain disclosure and consent pursuant to Section 4.3. See Attachment 1 for examples of modifications that are clearly and conspicuously  disclosed to end users.     6. Deactivation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that impairs an end user's ability to change any preferences or  settings set by the Application in accordance with the way that such preferences or settings ordinarily may be changed by the applicable  Application. Once disabled by an end user, your Application may not be re-enabled without an affirmative action by the end user to explicitly re- enable your application. Accordingly, no use, update, installation or re-enablement of a separate Application, and no code downloaded as a result  of browsing a Web site, may operate to re-enable your Application. Your Application must permit end users to uninstall it (in the customary place  the applicable operating system has designated for adding or removing programs, e.g., Add/Remove Programs control panel in Windows) in a  straightforward manner, without undue effort or skill. In addition, your Application, when running, must provide (in an easily found location) clear  and concise instructions on how it may be uninstalled. Once uninstalled, your Application must not leave behind any functionality or design  elements, and all setting changes made by the application, but not explicitly agreed to by the end user, should be reversed to the extent  practicable.     7. Bundling of Applications. In addition to the requirements set forth in the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these  Guidelines, in order for you to bundle any Application with a Google Application must satisfy each of the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (a) the end user is made aware of all of the Applications included in the bundle prior to any installation;\n\n  (b) all such Applications included in the bundle or download comply with the provisions of Section 2 through 6 of these  Guidelines;\n\n  (c) if Applications in a bundle in which you are participating are supported in part by revenue generated by advertising  displayed in another independent Application included in that bundle and the continued use of the Application is  conditioned on such other independent Application remaining installed and active on the end user's computer, the end  user must be made aware of that relationship; and\n\n  - 28 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   8. Information and Assistance. Subject to any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties, you must provide Google with such information as  Google may reasonably request about the distribution of those of your Applications that are bundled with any Google Application. For example,  we may ask you to share with us: (a) the means by and/or the locations from which your Applications are distributed; or (b) the identity of any  applications included in any of your bundling relationships (and the entities responsible for such applications). In addition, you must provide  such assistance as Google may reasonably request to investigate and stop potential violations of these Guidelines that may be connected to your  Application, including by way of using such number of identifiers and other tracking parameters as Google may reasonably request. This would  include providing Google with \"golden masters\" of any bundle or other distribution that includes your Application, or working with Google to  stop any entities that may be financially benefiting from your Application from engaging in any of these proscribed practices. You understand,  however, that Google has no obligation to provide support to end users of your Application. For the avoidance of doubt, these information and  assistance rights do not extend to any of your Applications that are not used to access Google services, bundled with a Google Application, or  bundled with an Application that accesses Google services.     9. Legal. You must maintain ownership and control of your Application at all times to the extent required to practically and legally enforce the  requirements of these guidelines. If you are seeking to permit a third party Application to be bundled with a Google Application, then you must  also obtain Google's written approval of that third party Application (in addition to the approval required for your Application). If Google  approves the third party Application, you are responsible for ensuring that such third party Application also complies with these Guidelines.  Special indemnity and other suspension and/or termination provisions may apply. These are addressed in your agreement with Google.     10. Updates.     10.1 General. As mentioned above, Google may update these Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time; provided,  however, that no updates will be effective until Google provides you with thirty (30) days' written notice thereof. Once you receive that notice (the  date on which you receive such notice, the \"Update Notice Date\"), you will be required to bring your Application into compliance within thirty (30)  days     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (d) either (1) the bundle must provide for a master uninstaller that will enable the end user to uninstall every Application in  the bundle without undue effort or skill, or (2) if no master uninstaller is provided, the de-installation of any Application  may not be dependent or conditioned upon the de-installation of any other Application included in the bundle.\n\n  - 29 -\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.2 Extended Compliance Period. If, solely as a result of an updated requirement, one or more of your Applications no longer complies  with these Guidelines, as updated, and you are incapable of bringing such Application into compliance prior to the scheduled effective date of  such update (the \"Update Effective Date\"), you agree to provide Google with written notice thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any  event no later than the Update Effective Date, identifying the Application and the reasons why it may not be brought into compliance prior to the  Update Effective Date, and providing such other detail as Google may reasonably request with respect thereto (consistent in any event with your  confidentiality obligations). Thereafter, the parties will consult, and you agree to will work, diligently and in good faith to develop and execute a  plan to bring such Application into compliance with these Guidelines, as updated, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within  ninety (90) days of the Update Notice Date (the \"Maximum Compliance Period\"). You agree that you will provide Google with such information as  Google reasonably requests during this period to keep Google apprised of your progress in bringing your Application into compliance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the next sentence), in no event may a new requirement provided for in any update to these  Guidelines require you to take any action which would violate the terms of any agreement between you and any unaffiliated third party that is in  effect on the date that Google delivers notice of the proposed update. In any event, if you are unable to bring any Application into compliance  during the Maximum Compliance Period, Google may elect, by providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, to require you to cease  bundling either the specific non-conforming Application or those versions of the Application which are, or are distributed, in violation of the  Guidelines, as updated; it being understood that, at such time, you will be entitled to procure services from an alternative source for those  Applications (or versions thereof) with respect to which Google has exercised such election.

If the parties agree that the Target Professional included on such list has (or should have) a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently practices in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then Dova will submit an inquiry to Dova's Third Party Data Source for each such Target Professional, requesting that Dova's Third Party Data Source conduct an investigation to determine the primary specialty designation of each such Target Professional. In addition, if the Parties do not agree, but Valeant, acting reasonably and in good faith, still believes that the Target Professional has (or should have) a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently practices in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then Dova will submit an inquiry to Dova's Third Party Data Source for each such Target Professional, requesting that Dova's Third Party Data Source conduct an investigation to determine the primary specialty designation of each such Target Professional. The Parties shall equally share in the incremental costs to Dova of any such investigations by Dova's Third Party Data Source.

In the event that, following such investigation, Dova's Third Party Data source does not change the primary specialty designation to Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology or, in the case of those Target Professionals with a primary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology, changes the primary specialty designation to a specialty other than Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then those Target Professionals shall be deemed not to be in the Specialty. For those Target Professionals that were not the subject of an inquiry to or an investigation by Dova's Third Party Data Source, then the specialty designations set out in the original list generated by Dova's Third Party Data Source shall apply for such Calendar Quarter, namely those Target Professionals that have either a\n\nSource: DOVA PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nprimary or a secondary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and that do not have either a primary or a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology shall be deemed to be in the Specialty.\n\n6.5.4 The process described in this Section 6.5 shall be repeated for each Calendar Quarter of the Term; provided, however, that, pursuant to the process described above, if Dova's Third Party Data Source has confirmed that a Target Professional's primary specialty designation should be or should remain Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, it is not necessary for Valeant to seek this confirmation in subsequent Calendar Quarters; provided, further, that, if Dova's Third Party Data Source is subsequently updated (by Dova or any Third Party) to change the specialty designation (primary or secondary) of a Target Professional, pursuant to a request by Dova or a Third Party, then the process described in this Section 6.5 shall be repeated with respect to such Target Professional.\n\nARTICLE 7  AUDIT RIGHTS\n\n7.1 Recordkeeping.

The Party seeking indemnification under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable (the \"Indemnified Party\") shall give prompt notice to the Party against whom indemnity is sought (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of the assertion or commencement of any Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to give such notice will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the defense and settlement of any such action, suit or proceeding at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects in such defense, at the Indemnifying Party's expense. The Indemnified Party will be entitled at its own expense to participate in such defense and to employ separate counsel for such purpose. For so long as the Indemnifying Party is diligently defending any proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.3, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, for any settlement effected without its consent. No Party shall enter into any compromise or settlement which commits the other Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action without the other Party's prior written consent (and unless such compromise or settlement includes no payments by the Indemnified Party, an unconditional release of, and no admission of liability by, the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim).\n\n11.4 Limitation of Liability.

THE FOREGOING SENTENCE SHALL NOT LIMIT (1) THE OBLIGATIONS OF EITHER PARTY TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY FROM AND AGAINST THIRD PARTY CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 11.1 OR 11.2, AS APPLICABLE, OR (2) DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE OBLIGATIONS IN ARTICLE 9.\n\n11.5 Insurance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that during the Term, it shall maintain, through purchase or self- insurance, adequate insurance, including products liability coverage and comprehensive general liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations under this Agreement and which are consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated. Each Party shall provide reasonable written proof of the existence of such insurance to the other Party upon request. Dova does not and will not maintain or procure any worker's compensation, healthcare, or other insurance for or on behalf of any Field Force Personnel, all of which shall be Valeant's sole responsibility. For clarity, the insurance requirements of this Section 11.5 shall not be construed to create a limit of either Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11.\n\nARTICLE 12  TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n12.1 Term.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved DOPTELET on May 21, 2018 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET represents the first thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved in the United States for this indication.\n\nThrombocytopenia, a condition in which patients have a low platelet count, is the most common hematological abnormality in patients with CLD that often worsens with the severity of liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the 7.5 million patients with CLD have some form of thrombocytopenia. In a study published in 2010, patients with severe thrombocytopenia (<75,000/\u00b5L) had a 31 percent incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increased rate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the CLD patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such as liver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures.\n\nAs part of the co-promotion arrangement, Salix intends to deploy approximately 100 sales specialists who will promote DOPTELET to gastroenterology healthcare professionals. The Salix sales force will begin selling DOPTELET in mid-October 2018. Dova will continue its commercial efforts targeting primarily hepatologists and interventional radiologists and certain other specialties. Pursuant to the agreement, Dova will pay Salix a quarterly fee based on net sales (as defined in the agreement) of DOPTELET prescribed by gastroenterologists in the U.S.\n\n\"We are delighted to be working with Salix, a company considered by many to have the preeminent gastroenterology sales force in the United States,\" said Alex C. Sapir, president and chief executive officer, Dova Pharmaceuticals. \"Given Salix's presence and strong reputation within large gastroenterology group practices coupled with the early interest we are seeing among the gastroenterology community, we are excited to see the impact this partnership will bring to DOPTELET and to patients.\"\n\n\"Salix considers liver disease a strategic therapeutic area of focus, given our history and knowledge with XIFAXAN\u00ae (rifaximin), an innovative medicine indicated for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition that is often a consequence of chronic liver disease,\" said Mark McKenna, president, Salix Pharmaceuticals. \"Adding DOPTELET to our portfolio will enable our sales force to promote yet another innovative product that addresses a true unmet need in the marketplace.\"\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

DOPTELET is designed to mimic the effects of TPO, the primary regulator of normal platelet production.\n\nTwo global Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ADAPT-1 [N=231] and ADAPT-2 [N=204]), conducted in adults with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 50,000/\u00b5L) and CLD, supported the FDA approval. Patients were assigned to either 40 mg or 60 mg of avatrombopag daily for five days based on their Baseline platelet counts (40 to <50,000/\u00b5mL or <40,000/\u00b5mL, respectively). Avatrombopag was shown to be superior to placebo in increasing the proportion of patients not requiring platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding up to seven days following a scheduled procedure in both trials in both the 40 mg (ADAPT-1, 88% vs. 38%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 88% vs. 33%; p<0.0001), and 60 mg (ADAPT-1, 66% vs. 23%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 69% vs. 35%; p=0.0006) treatment groups. Avatrombopag was also superior to placebo at the two secondary efficacy endpoints in each trial. In the avatrombopag treatment groups, there was an increased proportion of patients achieving the target platelet count of \u226550,000/\u00b5mL on procedure day, and a greater magnitude of the change in mean platelet count from baseline to procedure day; all treatment differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups for each secondary endpoint were highly statistically significant with p values <0.0001. The most common adverse reactions with avatrombopag included pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and edema peripheral. Portal vein thromboses have been reported in patients with CLD and in patients receiving TPO receptor agonists. One treatment-emergent event of portal vein thrombosis was reported in the ADAPT trials in an avatrombopag-treated patient.\n\nINDICATION\n\nDOPTELET (avatrombopag) is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nDOPTELET is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist and TPO receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic and thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease treated with TPO receptor agonists. In the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 clinical trials, there was one treatment- emergent event of portal vein thrombosis in a patient (n=1/430) with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia treated with DOPTELET.\n\nConsider the potential increased thrombotic risk when administering DOPTELET to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism, including genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210A, Antithrombin deficiency or Protein C or S deficiency).\n\nDOPTELET should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease in an attempt to normalize platelet counts.\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS: None\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

It has been proven to reduce the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalizations in adults.\n\n*There is an increased systemic exposure in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when administering XIFAXAN to these patients.\n\nINDICATION  XIFAXAN (rifaximin) 550 mg tablets are indicated for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) recurrence in adults and for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\u2022XIFAXAN is not for everyone. Do not take XIFAXAN if you have a known hypersensitivity to rifaximin, any of the rifamycin antimicrobial agents, or any of the components in XIFAXAN.\n\n\u2022If you take antibiotics, like XIFAXAN, there is a chance you could experience diarrhea caused by an overgrowth of bacteria (C. difficile). This can cause symptoms ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. Contact your healthcare provider if your diarrhea does not improve or worsens.\n\n\u2022Talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN if you have severe hepatic (liver) impairment, as this may cause increased effects of the medicine.\n\n\u2022Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking drugs called P-glycoprotein and/or OATPs inhibitors (such as cyclosporine) because using these drugs with XIFAXAN may lead to an increase in the amount of XIFAXAN absorbed by your body.\n\n\u2022In clinical studies, the most common side effects of XIFAXAN were: HE: Peripheral edema (swelling, usually in the ankles or lower limbs), nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), dizziness, fatigue (feeling tired), and ascites (a buildup of fluid in the abdomen)  IBS-D: Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and an increase in liver enzymes\n\n\u2022XIFAXAN may affect warfarin activity when taken together. Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking warfarin because the dose of warfarin may need to be adjusted to maintain proper blood-thinning effect.\n\n\u2022If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing, talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN because XIFAXAN may cause harm to an unborn baby or nursing infant. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800- FDA-1088.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

Immediately upon notification from PPI, such post termination  sales shall cease.   17.4 Other Remedies of EKR. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event that EKR is entitled to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 16.1(a), in addition to the right to terminate as provided therein and any other remedies EKR  may have hereunder, PPI shall assist EKR in the transfer of the manufacture of the Products, including the Specifications from PPI to EKR  or EKR's designee. In such event, the Royalty payments payable hereunder shall continue to be paid; provided,  however, that all costs  incurred by EKR in the transfer of manufacturing information from PPI and obtaining FDA approval of the manufacture of the Products by  EKR or EKR's designee, and any other amounts due to EKR, shall be deducted from any royalties payable to PPI. In addition, PPI shall  during the remainder of the Term and for a period of up to [**] ([**]) years thereafter continue to manufacture and supply the Product to  EKR at cost without mark-up until such time that EKR can secure an FDA approved manufacturing facility for the Product. PPI shall provide such advice as necessary for EKR to arrange for an alternative manufacturer and shall provide EKR with access to all relevant PPI  Know-How, and any other information necessary for EKR to transfer such manufacturing to an alternate manufacturer. In addition, (i) PPI  shall transfer to EKR any Marketing Authorizations held by PPI and (ii) the Trademark license granted under Section 2.3 shall continue in  effect following such termination on a perpetual basis and EKR shall be responsible for all costs associated with the maintenance of such  Trademark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -58-\n\n17.5 EKR Step-In Rights.\n\n\n\n(a) During the Term, in the event EKR has the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 16.1(a) - (i) hereof (the \"Step-in  Right Trigger Event\"), and EKR does not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement under such Section, EKR shall  have the option to exercise step-in rights to manufacture the Product for the remainder of the Term (the \"Step-in Right\") by  providing PPI written notice of such election within ninety (90) days after the Step-in Right Trigger Event (or such longer  period as mutually agreed by the Parties) (the \"Step-in Right Notice\"); provided that in the event such Step-in Right  Trigger Event has been cured prior to EKR's exercise of the Step-in Right, the Step-in Right shall terminate with respect to  such Step-in Right Trigger Event. The Step-in Right Notice shall specify the date which EKR intends to exercise the rights  associated with the Step-in Right.\n\n  (b) In the event EKR exercises the Step-in Right, PPI shall, at EKR's cost and expense, cooperate in the exercise of such rights  and EKR shall reimburse PPI for the reasonable costs PPI incurs in assisting EKR in the exercise of such rights within thirty  (30) days of EKR's receipt of invoice.\n\n\n\n(c) The Step-in Right shall include, without limitation, and to the extent allowable under Applicable Law, PPI's grant to EKR of  such additional license rights, rights of access, rights of observation and rights of management, direction and control, in  each case solely with respect to the manufacture and supply of Product and as reasonably necessary to enable and permit  EKR (or EKR's designee) to ensure that the supply of Product shall continue to be available to EKR under this Agreement  and the Supply Agreement; provided that EKR in exercising the Step-in Right shall not (i) unreasonably interfere with PPI's  other activities at the facilities at which the Product is manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -59-\n\n\n\notherwise handled (\"Product Facilities\") or (ii) require PPI to take any action or fail to take any action that does or could  reasonably be expected to interfere with PPI's other activities at the Product Facilities. The foregoing rights shall apply  with respect to any Product Facility to the extent necessary for EKR to preserve and protect supply of the Product as  contemplated by this Agreement and the Supply Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) upon termination of the Lease  Term, PPI shall maintain responsibility and control over all other products manufactured by PPI and nothing in this Section  17.5 shall give EKR any rights to direct, manage or control the manufacture of such products (ii) PPI shall maintain  responsibility and control over the facilities where Product is manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled  and nothing in this Section 17.5 shall give EKR general oversight or control of the facilities where Product is manufactured,  tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled.\n\n  (d) In the event EKR exercises the Step-in Right, EKR shall comply with all policies applicable to the facilities where Product is  manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled and all Applicable Laws with respect to the manufacture of the  Product.\n\n18. Force Majeure   18.1 Obligation to Perform. Except for payment obligations which shall not be excused or affected by any Force Majeure, neither Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement or shall be liable to the other under this Agreement for loss or damages attributable to any Force  Majeure, provided the Party affected shall give prompt notice thereof to the other Party. Subject to Section 18.2, the Party giving such  notice shall be excused from such of its obligations hereunder for so long as it continues to be affected by Force Majeure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -60-\n\n18.2 Duration. If such Force Majeure continues unabated for a period of at least ninety (90) days, the Parties will meet to discuss in good faith  what actions to take or what modifications should be made to this Agreement as a consequence of such Force Majeure in order to alleviate  its consequences on the affected Party. If the affected Party is prevented by reason of any circumstances referred to in this Section of this  Agreement from performing any of its obligations hereunder for a continuous period of six (6) months the other Party may terminate this  Agreement.\n\n19.

Subject to Section 20.2, neither Party shall, nor shall it purport to, assign, license, transfer or change any of its rights or  obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld  conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 20.4 either Party may assign its rights hereunder to an  Affiliate or to any successor by merger, consolidation, sale of stock or other equity interests or the sale of substantially all of the assets of  such Party without the consent of the other Party. For the avoidance of doubt, either Party may grant a security interest with respect to its  rights under this Agreement in connection with a secured financing or similar transaction.   20.2 Sub-Distribution. EKR may appoint sub-distributors under this Agreement provided that EKR:\n\n  (a) informs PPI of the identity of any Third Party sub-distributor (other than Affiliate companies) prior to the execution of any  sub-distribution agreement;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -62-\n\n  (b) obtain a confidential nondisclosure agreement with the prospective Sub-Distributor in a form acceptable to PPI, which  acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and containing terms at least as stringent as those terms  included in Article 11 of this Agreement;\n\n  (c) deliver to the prospective Sub-Distributor a redacted copy of this Agreement (\"Redacted Agreement\") .  Any sub- distribution agreement shall provide that such agreement is subject and subordinate to the rights of PPI under this  Agreement; and\n\n  (d) provides PPI with a copy of written sub-distribution agreement as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution  thereof by EKR.   20.3 Responsibility of EKR. Notwithstanding any such sub-distribution agreement, EKR shall remain primarily liable to PPI for its obligations hereunder, and for any act or omission of any sub-distributor.   20.4 Change of Control. Should there be a Change of Control of either Party resulting in the control of such Party by a Third Party which  markets or sells a Competing Product in any part of the Territory, then the rights under this Agreement may not be assigned without the  express consent of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. \"Change of Control\" shall mean (a) the sale, lease,  exchange, license or disposition of all or substantially all of the Party's assets in one transaction or series of related transactions or (b) a  merger or consolidation with an unaffiliated Third Party as a result of which the holders of the Party's issued and outstanding voting  securities immediately before such transaction own or control less than a majority of the voting securities of the continuing or surviving  entity immediately after such transaction. The issuance by either Party of securities in connection with any financing transaction or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -63-\n\n\n\npublic offering shall not be deemed a Change of Control under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of Section  6.3(b)(iii): (i) references to a \"Party\" in the above definition of Change of Control shall be deemed to include PPI as well as any Affiliate of  PPI and (ii) a Change of Control shall also include (in addition to any of the transactions described above in the definition of Change of  Control), any sale of securities of PPI or its Affiliates directly by the holder (the \"Holder\") of such securities (other than to an Affiliate of  such Holder) in which such sale results in a transfer of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of PPI or its Affiliates.\n\n21.

If and to the extent that any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such provision shall  be given no effect and shall be deemed not to be included in this Agreement but without invalidating any of the remaining provisions of  this Agreement.   21.9 Delay. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right or remedy provided by law under or pursuant to this Agreement shall  impair such right or remedy or operate or be construed as a waiver or variation of it or preclude its exercise at any subsequent time and no  single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right or  remedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(signature page follows)      -65-\n\n21.10 Cumulative Rights.

Indemnification and Contribution.\n\n(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Remarketing Agent, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Remarketing Agent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Remarketing Agent may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (i) the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any Preliminary Prospectus, Pricing Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or any \"issuer information\" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Remarketing Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Remarketing Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Pricing Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the     25\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement(s) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Remarketing Agent expressly for use therein.\n\n(b) Each Remarketing Agent will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Pricing Prospectus, the Registration Statement, or the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Pricing Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Remarketing Agent expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.\n\n(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection, to the extent the indemnifying party is actually materially prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party or any other indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof   26\n\n\n\n\n\nother than reasonable costs of investigation, unless (i) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations or circumstances.\n\n(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than due to the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities to which any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total Remarketing Fee received by the Remarketing Agents, as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.   27\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities remarketed by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Remarketed Securities and not joint.\n\n(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Act. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.\n\n7. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agents. A Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any or all of the Remarketing Agents, by giving five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the Remarketing Agents; provided that no such resignation nor any removal of all the Remarketing Agents shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor to the Remarketing Agents, and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a   28\n\n\n\n\n\nletter substantially in the form of Annex III hereof with the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agents pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement.\n\n8. New Remarketing Agents. The Company may appoint any institution or institutions as new Remarketing Agent(s) hereunder (each a \"New Remarketing Agent\") in respect of the Remarketing in which event, upon the confirmation by such institution through a letter to the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent confirming acceptance of such nomination by the New Remarketing Agent substantially in the form of Annex III hereof, such New Remarketing Agent shall become a party hereto, unless otherwise provided for herein, with all the authority, rights, powers, duties and obligations as if originally named as Remarketing Agent hereunder. The Company will notify the Remarketing Agent(s) appointed in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent of a change in the identity of other Remarketing Agents appointed or who have resigned in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities generally as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\n9. Offering Restrictions. Each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree that it has not remarketed or delivered and it will not remarket or deliver, any of the Remarketed Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that are reasonably designed to result in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations thereof. In particular, each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree as set forth in Annex V to this Remarketing Agreement.\n\n10. Dealing in the Remarketed Securities. Each Remarketing Agent, when acting hereunder, or when acting in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold or deal in any of the Remarketed Securities. The Remarketing Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketed Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agents, in their individual capacities, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder.\n\n11. Termination of Remarketing Agreement. This Remarketing Agreement shall terminate (i) in the event of a Remarketing that is not a Successful Remarketing or (ii) as to any Remarketing Agent who resigns or is removed, on the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 7. In addition, the   29\n\n\n\n\n\nobligations of the Remarketing Agents may be terminated by them by notice given to the Company prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time on the Remarketing Settlement Date if, prior to that time, any of the applicable conditions precedent to the obligations of the Remarketing Agents described in Section 5 hereof shall have failed to occur.\n\n12. Survival. Notwithstanding any such termination set forth in Section 11 hereof, the obligations set forth in Section 4 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under said Section 4 shall have been paid in full. In addition, the former Remarketing Agents shall be entitled to the rights and benefits under Section 6 of this Remarketing Agreement notwithstanding the replacement or resignation of the Remarketing Agents. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Remarketing Agents, as set forth in this Remarketing Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent or any controlling person of any Remarketing Agent, the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.\n\n13.

Counterparts. This Remarketing Agreement and the Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.\n\n19.

WHEREAS, Franchisor and Franchisee have executed a Franchise Agreement (\"Franchise Agreement\") granting Franchisee the right to operate a Franchised Business under the terms and conditions of the Franchise Agreement; WHEREAS, the Member, by virtue of his or her position with Franchisee, will gain access to certain of Franchisor's Confidential Information, as defined herein, and must therefore be bound by the same confidentiality and non-competition agreement that Franchisee is bound by. IN CONSIDERATION of these premises, the conditions stated herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 1. Confidential Information. Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member's relationship with Franchisee. All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (\"Confidential Information\") is deemed confidential, except for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member's attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the time of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain. 2. Covenants Not to Compete. (a) Member specifically acknowledges that, pursuant to the Franchise Agreement, and by virtue of its position with Franchisee, Member will receive valuable specialized training and Confidential Information, including, without limitation, information regarding the operational, sales, promotional, and marketing methods and techniques of Franchisor and the System. (b) Member covenants and agrees that during the term of the Franchise Agreement, except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, Member shall not, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, persons, partnership, corporation, or entity: (i) Own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, rent or lease to, or have any other interest in business that (directly or indirectly) operates, or grants franchises or licenses to operate, a restaurant featuring pizza and related food specialties or that offers products or services substantially similar to those then offered by Pizza Fusions Restaurants (\"Competitive Business\"); C - 1\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Divert or attempt to divert any business or customer, or potential business or customer, to any Competitive Business; or (iii) Induce any person to leave his or her employment with Franchisee or Franchisor. (c) Member covenants and agrees that during the Post-Term Period (defined below), except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, Member shall not, either directly or indirectly, own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, or have any other interest in any Competitive Business that is, or intends to operate, within a three (3) mile radius of the premises of your Franchised Business or within a three (3) mile radius of any Franchised Business then-operating or under construction to operate under the System. (d) As used in this Agreement, the term \"Post-Term Period\" shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of two (2) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); (c) termination of Member's employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity). 3. Injunctive Relief. Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement. 4. Severability. All agreements and covenants contained herein are severable. If any of them, or any part or parts of them, shall be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then the Member agrees that the court shall have the authority to reform and modify that provision in order that the restriction shall be the maximum necessary to protect Franchisor's and/or Franchisee's legitimate business needs as permitted by applicable law and public policy. In so doing, the Member agrees that the court shall impose the provision with retroactive effect as close as possible to the provision held to be invalid. 5. Delay. No delay or failure by the Franchisor or Franchisee to exercise any right under this Agreement, and no partial or single exercise of that right, shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right provided herein, and no waiver of any violation of any terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any succeeding violation of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. 6. Third-Party Beneficiary. Member hereby acknowledges and agrees that Franchisor is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Agreement with the right to enforce it, independently or jointly with Franchisee.

Any disputes relating to, arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, including to its execution, performance, or enforcement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof.

Any such interim measure (or a request therefor to a court of competent jurisdiction) shall not be deemed incompatible with the provisions of Section 11.02, Section 11.03 and Section 11.04. Until such Dispute is resolved in accordance with Section 11.02 or final judgment is rendered in accordance with Section 11.03 and Section 11.04, each 15\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nParty agrees that such Party shall continue to perform its obligations under this Agreement and that such obligations shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination.\n\nSection 11.06.

The other Party shall not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that money damages are an adequate remedy. The Parties agree that the remedies at Law for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond or similar security with such remedy are waived.\n\nSection 11.07. Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or as otherwise may be provided in the Separation Agreement with respect to the rights of any Nuance Indemnitee or SpinCo Indemnitee, in his, her or its respective capacities as such, (a) the provisions of this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the Parties hereto and are not intended to confer upon any Person except the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder and (b) there are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and this Agreement shall not provide any third person with any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right in excess of those existing without reference to this Agreement.\n\nSection 11.08.

Bankruptcy. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all rights and licenses granted by the other under or pursuant to this Agreement are, and shall otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended (the \"Bankruptcy Code\"), licenses of rights to \"intellectual property\" as defined under Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Nuance and the members of the Nuance Group and SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group, as licensees of such intellectual property rights under this Agreement, shall retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and elections under the Bankruptcy Code (including Nuance's and the Nuance Group members' and SpinCo's and the SpinCo Group members' right 17\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nto the continued enjoyment of the rights and licenses respectively granted by under this Agreement).\n\nSection 11.11. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof, or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances, or in jurisdictions other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon any such determination, any such provision, to the extent determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall be deemed replaced by a provision that such court determines is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, void or unenforceable provision.\n\nSection 11.12. Expenses. Except as set forth on Schedule XXIV to the Separation Agreement, as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement, (i) all third-party fees, costs and expenses incurred by either the Nuance Group or the SpinCo Group in connection with effecting the Spin-Off prior to or on the Distribution Date, whether payable prior to, on or following the Distribution Date (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any financing fees or interest payable in respect of any indebtedness incurred by SpinCo in connection with the Spin-Off), will be borne and paid by Nuance and (ii) all third-party fees, costs and expenses incurred by either the Nuance Group or the SpinCo Group in connection with effecting the Spin-Off following the Distribution Date, whether payable prior to, on or following the Distribution Date, will be borne and paid by the Party incurring such fee, cost or expense. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 11.12 shall not affect each Party's responsibility to indemnify Nuance Liabilities or SpinCo Liabilities, as applicable, arising from the transactions contemplated by the Distribution.\n\nSection 11.13. Headings. The article, section and paragraph headings contained in this Agreement, including in the table of contents of this Agreement, are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.\n\nSection 11.14. Survival of Covenants. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the covenants in this Agreement and the Liabilities for the breach of any obligations in this Agreement shall survive the Spin-Off and shall remain in full force and effect.\n\nSection 11.15. Waivers of Default. No failure or delay of any Party (or the applicable member of its Group) in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. Waiver by any Party of any default by the other Party of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver by the waiving Party of any subsequent or other default.\n\nSection 11.16. Amendments. No provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed waived, amended, supplemented or modified by any Party, unless such waiver, amendment, 18\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nsupplement or modification is in writing and signed by the authorized representative of each Party.\n\nSection 11.17.

Until the Parties have signed a written amendment appending the Updated SOPs, the parties will continue to follow the Current SOPs. The Parties will comply with the applicable SOPs in connection with the purchase and sale of products identified in a Purchase Schedule.

An incident of actual, alleged or suspected non-compliance by a Party with a warranty under this Section being investigated, contested or corrected in good faith by the Party and which, regardless of outcome, will have no material adverse effect on the Party or its performance under this Agreement or on the other Party, will not be considered a breach of this clause.

Buyer will defend and indemnify Seller against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Buyer; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Buyer in the purchase, storage, repackaging, resale or delivery of any product purchased from Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Buyer under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement to the extent based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license term in supplying the product; (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by governmental authority on Seller to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Buyer of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Buyer has agreed to defend and indemnify Seller against under a Purchase Schedule. d.

An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim.

(3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.\n\n8.

Exclusion of Indirect Damages; Waiver of Claim for Insured Damage or Loss. A Party that breaches this Agreement will only be liable to the other Party for direct damages arising from the breach. Each Party waives any right to recover consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary, punitive or any other types of indirect damages from the other Party for a breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, this Subsection will not limit the liability of a Party for any amount or type of damages for: (1) the defense and indemnification of an Indemnified Claim on which the Party is the Indemnifying Party; (2) infringement by the Party on the intellectual property of the other Party; (3) the unauthorized disclosure or use by the Party of the Confidential Information of the other Party; (4) payment or reimbursement of any amount expressly required to be paid or reimbursed by the Party under a provision of this Agreement; or (5) the intentional misconduct of the Party in violation of Applicable Laws. c. Force Majeure. A Party will not be considered in breach of this Agreement or liable to the other Party for any interruption or delay in performance under this Agreement to the extent caused by an event outside of the ability of the performing Party to foresee and avoid with the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts (such an event is referred to at times as an event of \"Force Majeure\"). Examples of events of Force Majeure include, without limitation: natural disasters; war; acts of terrorism; government action; accident; strikes, slowdowns and other labor disputes; shortages in or inability to obtain material, equipment, transportation or labor; any breach, negligence, criminal misconduct or other act or omission of any third-party; fire or other insured or uninsured casualty.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party will only be excused for an interruption or delay in performance under this Subsection for an event of Force Majeure only if the Party (1) promptly notifies the other Party of the event of Force Majeure and provides information reasonably requested by the other Party regarding the event of Force Majeure, the efforts undertaken by the\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nParty to foresee and avoid interruption or delay in its performance before the occurrence of the event, to mitigate interruption or delay in performance during the event, and to recover from and restore performance following the event; and (2) the Party exercises commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate, recover from and restore performance following the event of Force Majeure. During, and while recovering from and restoring performance following, an event of Force Majeure, Seller will act in good faith in allocating its available manufacturing capacity to supply products to Buyer under this Agreement and any products to other customers of Seller. If an event of Force Majeure interrupts or delays Seller from supplying a product to Buyer under this Agreement in the quantities and timetable required by Buyer, Buyer may cancel any unfilled orders for the product with Seller and procure the required quantities of the product from one or more other sources until Seller has recovered from and restored its ability to perform following the event of Force Majeure. If the interruption or delay in the supply of a product to Buyer under this Agreement caused by an event of Force Majeure has exceeded, or is reasonably likely to exceed, thirty (30) days, Buyer may enter into longer term supply agreements or make other arrangements to procure the required quantities of the product from one or more other sources for a duration and on terms acceptable to Buyer in its good faith discretion. In such a circumstance, Buyer will not have to resume purchasing the product from Seller under this Agreement until Seller has recovered from and restored its ability to perform following the event of Force Majeure and the longer term agreements or other arrangements have expired or Buyer is able to end them without liability. This Subsection will not excuse nor extend a deadline by which a Party must pay an amount owed under this Agreement or Applicable Law or by which a Party must exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement or Applicable Law.\n\n10. Confidential Information and Other Intellectual Property. a. The Parties anticipate exchanging Confidential Information (as defined in in the next Subsection) over the Term of this Agreement for the purpose of negotiating and entering into Purchase Schedules and amendments to this Agreement, transacting business with one in accordance with this Agreement and exercising their rights and performing their obligations under this Agreement (collectively referred to as the \"Authorized Purpose\"). b. The phrase \"Confidential Information\" means information meeting all of the following criteria: 1) The information is a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information owned by a Party or its direct and indirect subsidiaries under Applicable Law (this Party is referred to at times in this Section as the \"Disclosing Party\"); and 2) The other Party (referred to at times in this Section as the \"Receiving Party\") requests such information from the Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose during the Term (i.e., neither Party wants unsolicited Confidential Information from the other Party); and 3) The Disclosing Party discloses such requested information to the Receiving Party during the Term either labelled as \"Confidential\" or words of similar intent, or describes the disclosed information in reasonable detail in a written notice to the Receiving Party delivered, either at the time of disclosure or within five (5) days of disclosure. If a Disclosing Party neglects to label or deliver timely written notice to the Receiving Party identifying the disclosed information as confidential in nature, the disclosed information will only be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement if the Disclosing Party is able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Receiving Party knew that the disclosed information was a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information of the Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure.\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe criteria in Clause (2) and Clause (3) will not apply to Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party observed or heard by a Receiving Party in a plant, warehouse, facility or system of the Disclosing Party. The existence and terms of this Agreement, and the existence, nature and extent of the business relationship between the Parties, will be considered the Confidential Information of each Party. c.

(4) A Receiving Party and its Representatives may disclose and use the Confidential Information for any other purpose consented to by a Disclosing Party in a written notice signed by an officer of the Disclosing Party delivered to the Receiving Party. g.

(3) The Disclosing Party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Receiving Party and its Representatives against any claim of a third-party that the disclosure and use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as provided in this Agreement infringes on a patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property of the third-party registered in or otherwise recognized and enforceable under Applicable Laws.\n\nExcept for the limited representations and warranties in this Section, a Disclosing Party disclaims all other representations and warranties of any kind related to its Confidential Information, whether express, implied or arising by operation of law, including the disclaimer, without limitation, of any representation and warranties concerning merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, truth, accuracy or completeness. h. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Section with regards to disclosed Confidential Information will continue: (1) Until the earlier of (i) sixty (60) months from the date of disclosure to a Receiving Party or (ii) the date such information ceases to be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement, for Confidential Information that is not a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law; and (2) Until Confidential Information that is a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law ceases to be a trade secret of the Disclosing Party under Applicable Law. i. A Receiving Party will return or destroy all forms of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in the custody of the Receiving Party and its Representatives within ten (10) days of receipt of a written request from the Disclosing Party and after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

Dispute Resolution. a. Negotiation. If a Party believes that the other Party has breached this Agreement or if there is a dispute between the Parties over the interpretation of this Agreement (a \"Dispute\"), the Parties will endeavor to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiation for a period of thirty (30) days after a Party notifies the other Party of the Dispute and before either Party requests mediation or files litigation to resolve the Dispute. b. Mediation. If the Parties have been unable to resolve a Dispute through good faith negotiation as provided in the prior Subsection, a Party may request that the Parties attempt to resolve the Dispute through mediation by notifying the other Party with a copy to JAMS. The Parties will attempt to select a mutually acceptable JAMS mediator within ten (10) days of the notice requesting mediation.

Each party will bear its own costs in preparing for and participating in the mediation and one-half of the fees and expenses charged by JAMS for conducting the mediation. c. Litigation. If the Parties have been unable to resolve a Dispute through mediation as provided in the prior Subsection, a Party may file litigation against the other Party in a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States of America. With respect to litigation involving only the Parties or their Affiliates, the Parties irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the U.S. federal and Illinois state courts of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in Lake County, Illinois or Cook County, Illinois and their respective higher courts of appeal for the limited purpose of resolving a Dispute, and the Parties waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defense of inconvenient forum. The Parties waive any right to trial by jury as to any Disputes resolved through litigation.

Remedies. Except as expressly limited in the preceding Subsections and the other provisions in this Agreement, a Party may immediately exercise any rights and remedies available to the Party under Applicable Law upon a breach of this Agreement by the other Party. A Party will not suspend performance under or terminate this Agreement or any accepted purchase order for a product being purchased and sold under this Agreement unless: (1) the other Party is in material breach of this Agreement and has either refused to cure the material breach or has failed to cure the material breach within thirty (30) day of its receipt of written notice of the failure; and (2) the Parties have been unable to resolve the Dispute related to the material breach through negotiation or mediation, or the breaching Party has refused or failed to attempt to resolve the Dispute through negotiation or mediation, as provided in this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may suspend performance or terminate this Agreement or any accepted purchase order for a product being purchase and sold under this Agreement immediately on written notice to the other Party, and without providing the other Party an opportunity to cure the material breach or attempting to resolve a Dispute over the material breach by negotiation or mediation as provided in this Section, for a material breach by the other Party involving substantial harm to the reputation, goodwill and business of the non-breaching Party that cannot reasonably be avoided or fully redressed by providing the other Party an opportunity to cure the material breach. e. Late Fees and Collection Costs. If Buyer fails to pay Seller an amount owed under this Agreement by the invoice due date, then Buyer will owe Seller: (i) the delinquent amount; and (ii) a late payment fee equal to two percent (2%) of the delinquent amount for each full or partial calendar month past the invoice due date that the delinquent amount remains unpaid. In addition, if Seller has to file\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nlitigation to collect the amount owed and Seller prevails in the litigation, Buyer will reimburse Seller for actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in collecting the delinquent amount and accrued late payment fees on the delinquent amount. Under no circumstance will the late payment fee payable to Seller exceed the amount that a creditor may lawfully impose on a debtor on a delinquent amount under Applicable Law.\n\n12. Miscellaneous. a. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including its appended Exhibits and Purchase Schedules entered into during the Term, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the sale of products by Seller to Buyer and the purchase of products by Buyer from Seller.

No handwritten or other addition, deletion or other modification to the printed portions of this Agreement will be binding upon either Party to this Agreement. b. Amendments. A Party may not amend nor supplement the terms and conditions in this Agreement through the inclusion of additional or different terms and conditions in any quotation, purchase order, invoice, bill of lading, letter, email or other document or communication. This Section does not prevent the reliance on the descriptive information in transaction documents identifying the ordered Products (e.g., the type and quantity of ordered products and scheduled date and location for delivery). No amendment of this Agreement will be valid or effective unless made in writing and signed and exchanged by the chief executive officers of the Parties. A Party may approve or reject a request for an amendment in its sole and absolute discretion. c. Waiver. The failure of either party to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to take advantage of any of its rights shall not operate as a continuing waiver of such rights. No right or obligation under this Agreement will be considered to have been waived by a Party unless such waiver is in writing and is signed by an officer of the waiving Party and delivered to the other Party. No consent to or waiver of a breach by either Party will constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any other, different, or subsequent breach by such Party. d. Governing Law.

Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore.

As used in this Agreement, the terms \"registration statement,\" \"prospectus,\" and \"statement of additional information\" shall mean any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC and any amendments and supplements thereto which at any time shall have been filed with the SEC. The Fund represents and warrants to Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares.

The Fund shall not file any amendment to any registration statement or supplement to any prospectus or statement of additional information without giving Integrity reasonable notice thereof in advance; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall in any way limit the Fund's right to file at any time such amendments to any registration statement and/or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information, of whatever character, as the Fund may deem advisable, such right being in all respects absolute and unconditional. 3\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 4. INDEMNIFICATION Section 4.1 The Fund authorizes Integrity and any dealers with whom Integrity has entered into dealer agreements to use any prospectus or statement of additional information furnished by the Fund from time to time in connection with the sale of Shares. The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and governors, and any person who controls Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers or governors, and any such controlling person shall not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or representations made by Integrity or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are furnished to Integrity pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity and the Fund's representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which Integrity would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of Integrity's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement. The Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund's being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify the Fund of any such action shall not relieve the Fund from any liability that the Fund may have to the person against whom such action is brought by reason of any such untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of the Fund's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1. The Fund's indemnification agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1 and the Fund's representations and warranties in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Integrity, its officers and governors, or any controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of any Shares.

If the indemnifying party opts to assume the defense of such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than (a) reasonable costs of investigation or the furnishing of documents or witnesses and (b) all reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel to such indemnified party if (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the indemnified party shall have concluded reasonably that representation of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them in the conduct of the defense of such action.

Merchant acknowledges, and the Approval Order (as and when applicable) shall provide, that the Additional Agent Merchandise shall be consigned to Merchant as a true consignment under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of Delaware (the \"UCC\").

Subject to the Wind-Down Budget and payment of Expenses, Agent shall use the E-Commerce Platform in connection with the GOB Sale to fulfill customer orders made during the GOB Sale Term and otherwise promote the GOB Sale (in Agent's capacity as Agent hereunder), provided that Agent shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to terminate the use of the E-Commerce Platform at any time after four weeks of use. During the use of the E-Commerce Platform, and consistent with the Wind-Down Budget (i) Merchant shall continue to provide for the operation and maintenance of the E-Commerce Platform, including information technology and E-Commerce Platform updates, and provide Agent with all assistance with respect to the functionality of the E-Commerce Platform, fulfillment of orders, and promotion of the GOB Sale and (ii) Agent shall pay as an Expense those amounts reflected in Section 4.1(p) through and including the date that is seven (7) days after Agent provides Merchant with notice of Agent's intention to discontinue using the E-Commerce Platform as a sales platform to fulfill customer orders (the \"LDOB Date\"); provided, however, that, if Agent continues the Sale at the Stores after the LDOB Date, Merchant shall, as a Central Service and at no cost or expense to Agent (other than as provided in the Wind-Down Budget), maintain the E-Commerce Platform with limited functionality for the limited purposes\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 24 of 60\n\nof advertising and promoting the Sale at the Stores, periodically updating such advertising and promotions, and maintaining and updating the Store locator function at no cost or expense to Agent.

As part of the Allocation Schedule, Merchant and Agent shall mutually agree upon an allocation of certain On-line Merchandise to be promptly delivered to the Stores and not sold through the E-Commerce Platform (the \"Designated On-line Merchandise\").

Agent shall identify any such employees to be used in connection with the Sale (each such employee, a \"Retained Employee\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merchant's employees shall at all times remain employees of Merchant. Agent's selection and scheduling of Merchant's employees shall at all times comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Merchant and Agent agree that, except to the extent that wages and benefits of Retained Employees constitute Expenses hereunder, nothing contained in this Agreement and none of Agent's actions taken in respect of the Sale shall be deemed to constitute an assumption by Agent of any of Merchant's obligations relating to any of Merchant's employees including, without limitation, Excluded Payroll Benefits, Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act (\"WARN Act\") claims and other termination type claims and obligations, or any other amounts required to be paid by statute or law; nor shall Agent become liable under any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, or be deemed a joint or successor employer with respect to such employees. For the avoidance of doubt, Merchant shall be responsible for providing any required notice under the WARN Act with respect to its employees and otherwise comply with the WARN Act with respect to any \"plant closing\" or \"mass layoff' (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting the employees, whether before or after the date of this Agreement.

Agent may in its discretion stop using any Retained Employee at any time during the Sale, subject to the conditions provided for herein. In the event that Agent desires to cease using any Retained Employee, Agent shall notify Merchant at least seven (7) days prior thereto; provided, however, that, in the event that Agent determines to cease using an employee \"for cause\" (such as dishonesty, fraud or breach of employee duties), the seven (7) day notice period shall not apply; provided, further, however, that Agent shall immediately notify Merchant of the basis for such \"cause.\" From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Sale Termination Date, Merchant shall not transfer or dismiss employees of the Stores or Distribution Centers except \"for cause\" without Agent's prior consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent shall not have the right to terminate the actual employment of any employee, but rather may only cease using such employee in the Sale and paying any Expenses with respect to such employee (and all decisions relating to the termination or non-termination of such employees shall at all times rest solely with Merchant).\n\n9.3 Payroll Matters. During the Sale Term, Merchant shall process the payroll for all Retained Employees and any former employees and temporary labor engaged for the Sale. Each Wednesday (or such other date as may be reasonably requested by Merchant to permit the funding of the payroll accounts before such payroll is due and payable) during the Sale Term, Agent shall transfer to Merchant's payroll accounts an amount equal to the base payroll for Retained Employees plus related payroll taxes, workers' compensation and benefits for such week, to the extent such amount constitutes Expenses hereunder.\n\n9.4 Employee Retention Bonuses. Subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, Agent may pay, as an Expense, retention bonuses and/or severance pay (\"Retention Bonuses\") (which bonuses shall be inclusive of payroll taxes, but as to which no benefits shall be payable), up to a maximum of $7,400,000 in the aggregate, to such Retained Employees who do not voluntarily leave employment, are not otherwise entitled to receive severance pay, and are not terminated \"for cause,\" as Agent may determine in its discretion. Subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, the amount of such Retention Bonuses shall be in an amount to be determined by Agent, in its discretion, and shall be payable within thirty (30) days after the Sale Termination Date, and shall be processed through Merchant's payroll system.\n\nSection 10.

In the event of a claim under any such policies, Agent shall be responsible for the payment of all deductibles, retentions or self-insured amounts thereunder, unless it is determined that liability arose by reason of the willful misconduct or grossly negligent acts or omissions of Merchant or Merchant's employees, independent contractors or agents (other than Agent or Agent's employees, agents or independent contractors).

The Approval Order shall provide that (a) the counterparties to the Leases or Contracts identified in any Lease/Contract Assumption Notice shall have twenty-one days to object to the proposed assumption and assignment, (b) if no objection to the proposed assumption and assignment of a Lease or Contract is timely received, such Lease or Contract shall, upon payment of the applicable cure payment, if any, to the applicable counterparty, automatically be deemed assumed by Merchant and assigned to the assignee identified in the Lease/Contract Assumption Notice pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, without further order of the Bankruptcy Court or further action by any person or entity, and (c) if an objection to the proposed assumption and assignment of a Lease or Contract is timely received, such Lease or Contract shall not be assumed or assigned until such objection is resolved by agreement of the applicable counterparty or order of the Bankruptcy Court.\n\n(e) The designee under any Lease/Contract Assumption Notice shall be required, if requested by the applicable counterparty, to provide adequate assurance of future performance with respect to such Lease or Contract if the applicable counterparty so requests.\n\n(f) Merchant shall have no responsibility for any cure amounts with respect to any Lease or Contract assumption and assignment.\n\n14.2 Asset Designation Rights.\n\n(a) Upon the occurrence of the Closing, Agent shall have the exclusive right to market and sell, and/or otherwise designate the purchasers, licensees, transferees, and/or\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 33 of 60\n\nassignees of (which may in certain circumstances be Purchaser, any of the entities comprising Purchaser, any of their respective affiliates, and/or a new entity created by any of the foregoing), any or all of the Assets free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances thereon, without further order of the Bankruptcy Court (the \"Asset Designation Rights\").

No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent, any right, remedy, power, privilege or adjustment hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, privilege, or adjustment hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, privilege, or adjustment.\n\n15.13 Entire Agreement.

The Sale shall be conducted so that the Stores in which sales are to occur will remain open no longer than during the normal hours of operation provided for in the respective leases for the Stores.\n\nB. The Sale shall be conducted in accordance with applicable state and local \"Blue Laws\", where applicable, so that no Sale shall be conducted on Sunday unless the Merchant had been operating such Store on a Sunday.\n\nC. On \"shopping center\" property, Agent shall not distribute handbills, leaflets or other written materials to customers outside of any Stores' premises, unless permitted by the lease or, if distribution is customary in the \"shopping center\" in which such Store is located; provided that Agent may solicit customers in the Stores themselves. On \"shopping center\" property, Agent shall not use any flashing lights or amplified sound to advertise the Sale or solicit customers, except as permitted under the applicable lease or agreed to by the landlord.\n\nD. At the conclusion of the Sale or the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, Agent shall vacate the Stores in broom clean condition; provided that Agent may abandon any FF&E not sold in the Sale at the Stores, the Distribution Centers, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices at the conclusion of the Sale or the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, without cost or liability of any kind to Agent. Any abandoned FF&E left in a Store or Distribution Center, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices after a lease is rejected shall be deemed abandoned to the landlord having a right to dispose of the same as the landlord chooses without any liability whatsoever on the part of the landlord to any party and without waiver of any damage claims against the Merchant. For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Sale Termination Date or termination of the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, Agent may abandon, in place and without further responsibility or liability of any kind, any FF&E located at a Store or, Distribution Center, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices.\n\nE. Following, and subject to, the entry of the Approval Order, Agent may advertise the Sale as a \"store closing\", \"sale on everything\", \"everything must go\" or similar-themed sale, as dictated by the Approval Order.\n\nF. Agent shall be permitted to utilize display, hanging signs, and interior banners in connection with the Sale; provided, however, that such display, hanging signs, and interior banners shall be professionally produced and hung in a professional manner. The Merchant and Agent shall not use neon or day-glo on its display, hanging signs, or interior banners. Furthermore, with respect to enclosed mall locations, no exterior signs or signs in common areas of a mall shall be used unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Sale Guidelines. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize exterior banners at (i) non- enclosed mall Stores and (ii) enclosed mall Stores to the extent the entrance to the applicable Store does not require entry into the enclosed mall common area; provided, however, that such banners shall be located or hung so as to make clear that the Sale is being conducted only at the affected Store, shall not be wider than the storefront of the Store, and shall not be larger than 4 feet x 40 feet. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize sign walkers in a safe and professional manner and in accordance with the terms of the Approval Order. Nothing contained in these Sale Guidelines shall be construed to create or impose upon Agent any additional restrictions not contained in the applicable lease agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 59 of 60\n\nF. Conspicuous signs shall be posted in the cash register areas of each of the affected Stores to effect that \"all sales are final.\"\n\nG. Except with respect to the hanging of exterior banners, Agent shall not make any alterations to the storefront or exterior walls of any Stores.\n\nH. Agent shall not make any alterations to interior or exterior Store lighting. No property of the landlord of a Store shall be removed or sold during the Sale. The hanging of exterior banners or in- Store signage and banners shall not constitute an alteration to a Store.\n\nI. Agent shall keep Store premises and surrounding areas clear and orderly consistent with present practices.\n\nJ. Subject to the provisions of the Agreement, Agent shall have the right to sell all Owned FF&E at the Closing Stores and the Distribution Centers, the Headquarters and (subject to any side letter between JV Agent and Purchaser, which shall not in any way affect Merchant's rights under the Agreement) and Purchaser shall have the right to sell all Owned FF&E at the Designation Rights Stores and the Nebraska Distribution Center. JV Agent may advertise the sale of the Owned FF&E in a manner consistent with these guidelines at the Closing Stores and the Indiana Distribution Center and Purchaser may advertise the sale of the Owned FF&E in a manner consistent with these guidelines at the Designation Rights Stores and the Nebraska Distribution Center. The purchasers of any Owned FF&E sold during the sale shall be permitted to remove the Owned FF&E either through the back shipping areas at any time, or through other areas after applicable business hours. For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Sale Termination Date or the termination of the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, Agent may abandon, in place and without further responsibility, any FF&E at the Stores, the Distribution Centers, the Headquarters, and Merchant's other corporate offices.\n\nK. Agent shall be entitled to include Additional Agent Merchandise in the Sale in accordance with the terms of the Approval Order and the Agreement.\n\nL. At the conclusion of the Sale at each Store, pending assumption or rejection of applicable leases, the landlords of the Stores shall have reasonable access to the Stores' premises as set forth in the applicable leases. The Merchant, Agent and their agents and representatives shall continue to have access to the Stores as provided for in the Agreement.\n\nM. Post-petition rents shall be paid by the Merchant as required by the Bankruptcy Code until the rejection or assumption and assignment of each lease. Agent shall have no responsibility to the landlords therefor.\n\nN. The rights of landlords against Merchant for any damages to a Store shall be reserved in accordance with the provisions of the applicable lease.\n\nO. If and to the extent that the landlord of any Store affected hereby contends that Agent or Merchant is in breach of or default under these Sale Guidelines, such landlord shall email or deliver written notice by overnight delivery on the Merchant, JV Agent and Purchaser as follows:\n\nIf to Agent:\n\nGreat American Group, LLC Attn: Scott Carpenter (scarpenter@greatamerican.com)\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 60 of 60 Alan Forman (aforman@brileyfin.com)\n\nand\n\nTiger Capital Group, LLC Attn: Christopher Huber (chuber@tigergroup.com) Mark Naughton (mnaughton@tigergroup.com)\n\nand\n\nWilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB Attn: [_]\n\nWith copies (which shall not constitute notice) to:\n\nLowenstein Sandler LLP Counsel to Great American Group LLC Attn: Kenneth A.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall be permitted to disclose Confidential Information without any violation of this Agreement if such disclosure is required by law, but in such event the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing in advance of such disclosure, and provide the Disclosing Party with copies of any related information so that the Disclosing Party may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party may cause irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. The Disclosing Party shall, therefore, be entitled to injunctive relief upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in violation of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as may be available at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall promptly advise the Disclosing Party in the event that the Receiving Party learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party through the Receiving Party has violated or intends to violate the terms of this Agreement.\n\n      5.3 Receiving Party's Duty of Care. Receiving Party shall protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by exercising the same degree of care that Receiving Party uses with respect to information of its own of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care, until five (5) years from the later of the Effective Date or the date of receipt of such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, with respect to Receiving Party's employees, Receiving Party shall only disclose Confidential Information to a Receiving Party employee who has a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement or any customer sublicense and is informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information. The foregoing notwithstanding, each Party shall be liable for any failure by such Party's employees, agents or representatives to comply with the\n\n\n\n\n\nprovisions of this Section 5 as fully as if such employees, agents or representatives were a party to this Agreement.\n\n                                   ARTICLE VI\n\n                                   WARRANTIES\n\n      6.1 On2 Warranties.

Wildform represents and warrants to the Buyer that such Wildform is             acquiring the Payment Shares for investment purposes and not with a             view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof or             with any present intention of selling the Payment Shares in             connection with a distribution. Wildform has the capacity to protect             its own interest, can bear the economic risk of its investment, and             has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters             that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the             investment in the Payment Shares. Wildform acknowledges that an             investment in the Payment Shares represents a high degree of risk\n\n            and that there is no assurance that Buyer's business or operations             will be successful. Wildform has considered carefully the risks             attendant to an investment in the Payment Shares and acknowledges             that, as a consequence of such risks, such Wildform could lose its             entire investment in the Payment Shares.

Wildform acknowledges that it may dispose of             the Payment Shares only pursuant to an effective registration             statement under the Act or an exception from registration if             available.

If and to the extent that, as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction, ownership, title, or any rights or interest in or to any of the Assigned IP cannot be assigned as provided in Section 2.1(b)(i), (A) the Seller irrevocably agrees to (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) assign and transfer, and the Seller hereby assigns and transfers (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to assign and transfer) to the Purchaser Assignees all rights (including all economic and commercialization rights) that can be assigned pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i) to the fullest extent permissible, and (B) the Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser Assignees, and hereby agrees to cause the other Seller Parties to grant to the Purchaser Assignees, an unlimited, exclusive, irrevocable, assignable, transferable, sublicenseable, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, fully-paid up license to use, exploit, and commercialize in any manner now known or in the future discovered and for whatever purpose, any and all rights to Assigned IP that cannot be assigned as contemplated by Section 2.1(b)(i).\n\n(iii) Patent Review Process.\n\n(A) Information Exchange. Within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date, Seller shall provide (I) to the Purchaser, an updated list of all Patents (other than those set forth on Schedule 1.1(l) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule) owned by any Seller Party that (x) have an effective filing date or are based on an invention disclosure having a date of disclosure that is on or after January 9, 2007, and (y) that name as inventors, in Seller's reasonable, good-faith belief, one or more Business Employees and one or more Persons that are not Business Employees (the \"Patent Review List\"), and (II) to the Invention Disclosure Review Team, a list of invention disclosures (other than those set forth on Schedule 1.1(l) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule or Schedule 1.1(j)) owned by any Seller Party that name as contributors one or more Business Employees   14\n\n\n\n\n\nand one or more Persons that are not Business Employees (which list shall include the contributors, the title thereof, and the \"location code\" therefor) (the \"Invention Disclosure Review List\"). The Patent Review List shall include the Patents set forth on Schedule 2.1(b)(iii)(A).\n\n(B) Patent Review and Ownership. The parties shall promptly review the Patent Review List and, in good-faith, discuss and negotiate during the Review Period whether any of the Patents listed on such Patent Review List (each, a \"Shared Review Patent\") should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, based upon the general guideline and principle that Shared Review Patents that are primarily paid for, primarily used by, or primarily arising out of, or for which associated costs and fees were primarily allocated to, the Business or any Acquired Company (as compared with the Seller Business) should be or should have been, as applicable, Assigned Patents. Seller shall provide to Purchaser, upon Purchaser's reasonable request during the Review Period, information regarding such Patent Review List, the Patents listed thereon, and each such determination. If the parties agree, during the Review Period, that a Shared Review Patent should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, then, if such agreement was reached on or prior to the Initial Closing Date, the parties shall add such Shared Review Patent to Schedule 1.1(l) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule and, if such agreement was reached after the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) promptly execute a Contract containing a present grant of assignment (or, if and to the extent, as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction, ownership, title, or any rights or interest in or to any such Shared Review Patent cannot be so assigned, a license) of such Shared Review Patent to the Purchaser Assignees, consistent with the terms and conditions of Section 2.1(b)(i) or Section 2.1(b)(ii), as applicable. If the parties cannot agree on whether any Shared Review Patent should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, the parties shall, during the Review Period, escalate such dispute to successively more senior-levels of executives and shall each make sure each such senior executive is promptly available to speak with (including by telephone) his or her counterpart.\n\n(C) Invention Disclosure Review and Ownership. During the Review Period, within seventy-five (75) days after the Effective Date (or, in the event of any repeat of the process set forth in this Section 2.1(b)(iii)(C) in accordance with Section 2.1(b)(iii)(D), promptly (and no later than seventy-five (75) days) thereafter), Seller shall cause (on and prior to the Initial Closing Date), or the parties shall each cause (following the Initial Closing Date), as applicable, their respective employees on the Invention Disclosure Review Team to: (I) promptly review the Invention Disclosure Review List; (II) in good-faith determine whether any of the invention disclosures (and inventions listed on the Invention Disclosure Review List (and inventions described therein))   15\n\n\n\n\n\n(each, a \"Shared Review Invention Disclosure\") should be or should have been, as applicable, Assigned Know-How, based upon the general guideline and principle that Shared Review Invention Disclosures that are primarily paid for, primarily used by, or primarily arising out of, or for which associated costs and fees were primarily allocated to, the Business or any Acquired Company (as compared with the Seller Business) should be Assigned Know-How; and (III) provide to Purchaser the applicable Invention Disclosure Review List and such determinations of the Invention Disclosure Review Team with respect to such Invention Disclosure Review List.\n\nSeller shall provide to Purchaser, upon Purchaser's reasonable request during the Review Period, information regarding such Invention Disclosure Review List, the invention disclosures listed thereon, and each such determination; provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to disclose to Purchaser the content of any Shared Review Invention Disclosure in response to any such request. Upon review of such determinations or information, as applicable, the parties shall promptly jointly review such determinations and information, during the Review Period, and determine, in good faith, whether the Invention Disclosure Review Team should re-review any Shared Review Invention Disclosures on such Invention Disclosure Review List and, if so, the parties shall repeat the process set forth in this Section 2.1(b)(iii)(C) with respect to such Shared Review Invention Disclosures. If the Invention Disclosure Review Team determines, during the Review Period, that a Shared Review Invention Disclosure should be or should have been, as applicable, Assigned Know- How, then, if such agreement was reached on or prior to the Initial Closing Date, the parties shall add such Shared Review Invention Disclosure to Schedule 1.1(j) and, if such agreement was reached after the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) promptly execute a Contract containing a present grant of assignment (or, if and to the extent, as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction, ownership, title, or any rights or interest in or to any such Shared Review Invention Disclosure cannot be so assigned, a license) of such Shared Review Invention Disclosure to the Purchaser Assignees, consistent with the terms and conditions of Section 2.1(b)(i) or Section 2.1(b)(ii), as applicable.\n\n(D) Newly Identified Business Employee. If, during the Review Period, the Purchaser identifies a Person (\"New Business Employee\") that the Purchaser reasonably believes, in good faith, is or was a Business Employee and (I) such New Business Employee is not named as a contributor on any Shared Review Invention Disclosure on an Invention   16\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure Review List and is not named as an inventor on any Shared Review Patent on a Patent Review List, in each case previously provided to the Purchaser, or (II) Purchaser reasonably believes, in good faith, that Seller has not provided a complete and accurate Invention Disclosure Review List or Patent Review List with respect to any Patents or invention disclosures for which such New Business Employee is named as an inventor or contributor, respectively, then in each case of clauses (I) and (II), the Purchaser may notify Seller of such belief, and Seller shall promptly (but in no event more than thirty (30) days following such notice) provide to the Purchaser or the Invention Disclosure Review Team, as applicable, an updated Patent Review List and Invention Disclosure Review List with respect to such New Business Employee, and the parties shall repeat the process set forth in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B) and Section 2.1(b)(iii)(C) with respect to such updated Patent Review List and Invention Disclosure Review List, respectively.\n\n(E) Inventors Are All Business Employees. If (i) during the Review Period, Purchaser identifies a Patent or invention disclosure owned by any Seller Party where all of the inventors of such Patent or all of the contributors of such Invention Disclosure, respectively, are Business Employees, and (ii) Purchaser provides to Seller the evidence on which Purchaser is basing such identification, then such Patent or Invention Disclosure shall be an Assigned Patent or Assigned Know-How, as applicable, and the parties shall, where applicable on or prior to the Initial Closing Date, add such Patent or invention disclosure, as applicable, to Schedule 1.1(l) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule or Schedule 1.1(j), as applicable, or, where applicable after the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) promptly execute a Contract containing a present grant of assignment (or, if and to the extent, as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction, ownership, title, or any rights or interest in or to any such Patent or Invention Disclosure, as applicable, cannot be so assigned, a license) of such Patent or Invention Disclosure, as applicable, to the Purchaser Assignees, consistent with the terms and conditions of Section 2.1(b)(i) or Section 2.1(b)(ii), as applicable.\n\n(F) Arbitration. Attached as Schedule 2.1(b)(iii)(F) is a schedule of additional Patents provided by Seller to Purchaser prior to the Effective Date for review with respect to ownership allocation between the parties pursuant to the general guidelines and principles set forth in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B) (the \"Additional Patents\"). The parties shall promptly, in good- faith, discuss and negotiate whether any of the Additional Patents should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent. If any of such Additional Patents are not reviewed, or the parties cannot agree on whether any Additional Patent should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, prior to the Initial Closing Date, then the parties shall escalate such dispute to successively more senior-levels of executives as set forth in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B). If such senior-levels of executives cannot resolve the dispute with respect to any such Patents (the \"Outstanding Patents\") by the Initial Closing Date, then either party may, within thirty (30) days after the Initial Closing Date,   17\n\n\n\n\n\nsubmit such Outstanding Patents for dispute resolution as follows. One or both parties may, within thirty (30) days after the Initial Closing Date, submit the dispute with respect to such Outstanding Patents for arbitration in Chicago, Illinois before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, as those Rules may be amended by written agreement of the parties. The parties shall cooperate, in good faith, prior to the commencement of any arbitration under this Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F), to agree to any such amendments or other processes with respect to such arbitration (e.g., timing of the arbitration, arbitrator's familiarity with patent law). The parties shall instruct the arbitrator, and the arbitrator shall resolve each dispute regarding the ownership of each Outstanding Patent, based upon the general guideline and principle that such Outstanding Patents that are primarily paid for, primarily used by, or primarily arising out of, or for which associated costs and fees were primarily allocated to, the Business or any Acquired Company (as compared with the Seller Business) should be or should have been, as applicable, Assigned Patents. The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of all information, documents and materials disclosed and statements made in connection with any negotiations or arbitration proceeding, and any arbitration proceeding and the judgment, including any hearing or award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits. The parties shall each bear their respective costs and expenses with respect to any arbitration pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F); provided, however, that the parties shall equally share (on a 50/50 basis) the cost of the arbitrator. If the arbitrator determines that any Outstanding Patent should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) assign such Patent to the Purchaser Assignees in accordance with Section 2.1(b)(iii)(E).\n\n(c) License-Back of Patents. Effective as of the Initial Closing Date, the Purchaser will cause each Acquired Company and each Purchaser Assignee to grant, following each applicable Closing Date, to the Seller Parties, an irrevocable (except as expressly set forth herein), perpetual, non-sublicenseable (except as expressly set forth herein), fully paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide, non-transferable (except as expressly set forth herein), non-exclusive license, under the Acquired Company Patents and Assigned Patents:\n\n(i) (A) to use the Acquired Company Patents and Assigned Patents in the operation of the Seller Business and to practice any methods, processes, and procedures in connection therewith and (B) to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise dispose of products, services, and systems that were designed, developed, manufactured, distributed, offered for sale, sold, resold, supported, otherwise under development, or provided, as of the applicable Closing Date, by the Seller Parties in connection with the Seller Business and to practice any methods, processes, and procedures in connection therewith, and in each case of clauses (A) and (B), including with respect to all Derivative Works and natural evolutions thereof;   18\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise dispose of Smart Sensing Network Equipment; and\n\n(iii) to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise dispose of Public Safety LTE Smartphone Devices.\n\n(d) License-Back of Non-Patent, Non-Trademark IP.

The licenses granted pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i), Section 2.1(c)(ii), Section 2.1(d)(i), and Section 2.1(d)(ii) do not extend to any product, system, or service if and solely to the extent such product, system, or service constitutes or includes a Seller Excluded Product; provided, that if any such Seller Excluded Product is a Type of Enterprise Mobile Computing Product, then if and solely to the extent that such Seller Excluded Product is a Permitted Type of Enterprise Mobile Computing Product, such licenses will extend solely to such Permitted Type of Enterprise Mobile Computing Product that constitutes such product, system, or service or, as included in such product, system, or service, is included in such product, system, or service, as applicable. By way of example, if a Seller Excluded Product is a single component of a product, system, or service that is otherwise licensed under Section 2.1(c)(i), Section 2.1(c)(ii), Section 2.1(d)(i), or Section 2.1(d)(ii) and such Seller Excluded Product is not a Permitted Type of Enterprise Mobile Computing Product, such licenses do not extend to such component, but such licenses do extend to the remainder of such licensed product, system, or service.

Purchaser agrees that the quality of all Seller Excluded Products and any other products and services marketed or sold by the Purchaser Licensees under the Licensed Trademarks will conform to at least the level of quality of the Enterprise Products as currently provided by the Seller Entities as of the Initial Closing Date. Purchaser will (and will cause each Purchaser Licensee to) reasonably cooperate with Seller in facilitating Seller's control of such quality, permit reasonable inspection of the Purchaser Licensees' operations (upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours) solely with respect to their respective use of the Licensed Trademarks (if any), and supply Seller with specimens of any of their respective uses of the Licensed Trademarks (if any), including such specimens that are advertising or marketing materials, upon Seller's reasonable request, at Seller's expense.\n\n(d) Transitional Trademark License.\n\n(i) License Grant.

If either party acquires a business or a Person that conducts a business covering any of the same products, systems, or services as those covered by any license granted under Article II to such acquiring party (a \"Future Acquisition\") (whether in an asset or equity transaction), any such license shall be deemed to apply to such same products, systems, and services (but no other products, systems or services) of such acquired business or Person; provided, that all Patents acquired in connection with such Future Acquisition are licensed to the non-acquiring party and, in the case of Seller, the Seller Parties or, in the case of Purchaser, the Purchaser Licensees, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this IP Agreement. In such event, any such acquired Person shall be deemed a Seller Party or a Purchaser Licensee hereunder, as the case may be.\n\nSection 6.5 Further Assurances.

This IP Agreement, together with the other Transaction Agreements and any side letters executed by the parties in connection therewith, and all of the exhibits and schedules appended hereto and thereto, constitute the final, complete and exclusive statement of the parties' agreement on the matters contained herein and therein.

A written waiver given for one matter or occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the purpose stated. A waiver once given is not to be construed as a waiver for any other matter or occasion. Any enumeration of a party's rights and remedies in this Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a party's rights and remedies are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by Law and include any rights and remedies authorized in Law or in equity.\n\nSection 6.12 Notices.

This Agreement is non-exclusive. RECITALS WHEREAS, the Company has asked to retain Consultant to provide various services to the Company as agreed to by both parties and outlined in Section 3; and WHEREAS, the Consultant has advised the Company of its willingness and desire to provide such services as outlined in Section 3 and on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, the Parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 1. CONDITIONS. This Agreement will not take effect, and Consultant will have no obligation to provide any service whatsoever, unless and until the Company sends a signed copy of this Agreement to Consultant (either by mail or facsimile copy). The Company shall be truthful with Consultant in regard to any relevant material regarding the Company, verbally or otherwise, or this entire Agreement will terminate and all consideration paid shall be forfeited without further notice. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company agrees to cooperate with Consultant in carrying out the purposes of this Agreement, keep Consultant informed of any developments of importance pertaining to the Company's business and abide by this Agreement in its entirety. 2. TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall be in full force and effect commencing on January 2, 2020 and shall remain in effect for one (1) year or until Consultant completes the services requested. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without notice in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other Party. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with notice, and the effective date of termination shall be the date such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the terminated Party. 3. CONSULTING SERVICES. During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will perform the services described below (the \"Consulting Services\") for the Company. (a) Transactional Business (i) Further development of the business plan for the Company's subsidiaries; and 1 ____ ____\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Seek and advise the Company on the acquisition of potential products for the Company's subsidiaries; and (iii) Assist in negotiating acquisition or merger consideration as required by the Company; and (iv) Setting up meetings between the Company and acquisition candidates and arranging other liaisons between them; and (v) Assist the Company with certain day to day tasks of managing the Company's subsidiaries; and (vi) Assist in the sale of any inventory held by any of the Company's subsidiaries; and (vii) Assist in the sale of any future products acquired, licensed or developed by the Company and or its subsidiaries. 4. STANDARD OF PERFORMANCE. Consultant shall devote such time and efforts to the affairs of the Company as is reasonably necessary to render the services contemplated by this Agreement. Consultant is not responsible for the performance of any services that may be rendered hereunder if the Company fails to provide the requested information in writing prior thereto. The services of Consultant shall not include the rendering of any legal opinions or the performance of any work that is in the ordinary purview of a certified public accountant. Consultant cannot guarantee results on behalf of the Company but shall use commercially reasonable efforts in providing the services listed above. Consultant's duty is to identify prospective acquisition/joint venture companies for the Company. Consultant will in no way act as a \"broker-dealer\" under state securities laws. Because all final decisions pertaining to any particular investment are to be made by the Company, the Company may be required to communicate directly with potential acquisition/joint venture prospective companies. 5. COMPENSATION TO CONSULTANT. As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition. The Consultant will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to the Consultant's performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. The Company will regularly report amounts paid, if any, to the Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC and/or other appropriate form with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law. Because the Consultant is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security; make consulting contract insurance or disability insurance contributions; or obtain worker's compensation insurance on the Consultant's behalf. The Consultant agrees to accept exclusive liability for complying with all applicable state and federal laws governing self-employed individuals, including obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability and other contributions based on fees paid to the Consultant under this Agreement. The Consultant hereby agrees to indemnify and defend the Company against any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and interest. 2 ____ ____\n\n\n\n\n\n6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Consultant and the Company acknowledge that each will have access to proprietary information regarding the business operations of the other and agree to keep all such information secret and confidential and not to use or disclose any such information to any individual or organization without the non-disclosing Parties prior written consent. It is hereby agreed that from time to time Consultant and the Company may designate certain disclosed information as confidential for purposes of this Agreement. 7. INDEMNIFICATION.

The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claims, damages, or liabilities caused by the sole negligence of the Indemnified Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees. The Indemnified Party shall notify promptly the Indemnifying Party of the existence of any claim, demand, or other matter to which the Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations would apply, and shall give them a reasonable opportunity to settle or defend the same at their own expense and with counsel of their own selection, provided that the Indemnified Party shall at all times also have the right to fully participate in the defense. If the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after this notice, fails to take appropriate steps to settle or defend the claim, demand, or the matter, the Indemnified Party shall, upon written notice, have the right, but not the obligation, to undertake such settlement or defense and to compromise or settle the claim, demand, or other matter on behalf, for the account, and at the risk, of the Indemnifying Party. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Article shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, and heirs of the Parties. 8. COVENANTS OF CONSULTANT.

If a dispute arises out of or relates to this contract, or the breach thereof, and if the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation, the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Procedures before resorting to arbitration, litigation, or some other dispute resolution procedure. If they do not reach such solution within a period of 60 days, then, upon notice by either party to the other, all disputes, claims, questions, or differences shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules.

Franchise Agreement This Franchise Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is entered into as of the Agreement Date shown on the cover page between Pizza Fusion Holding, Inc., a Florida corporation, and the individual or legal entity identified on the cover page (\"Franchisee\"). If Franchisee is a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, then the Franchisee's owner(s) are also identified on the cover page. In this Agreement, \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refers to Pizza Fusion Holding, Inc., the franchisor. \"You\" and \"your\" refers to the Franchisee. \"Owners\" means the person(s) listed on the cover page and all other persons whom we may subsequently approve to acquire an interest in Franchisee. \"Operating Principal\" means the person designated as the Operating Principal on the cover page and who meets the criteria in Section 6.15 of this Agreement. RECITALS A. We are in the business of franchising others to operate \"Pizza Fusion\" restaurant businesses, which feature a competitively priced menu of organic and all-natural gourmet pizza and related food specialties, and standards and methods of operation designed to be \"green,\" and which are operated in buildings that bear our interior and/or exterior trade dress (each a \"Restaurant\" or \"Franchised Business\"). B. We have developed a distinctive set of specifications and operating procedures (collectively, the \"System\") for Restaurants. The distinguishing characteristics of the System include: dough, sauce, and other recipes and products that are prepared or manufactured in accordance with our proprietary and/or secret recipes, trade secrets, standards, and specifications that we deem secret (\"Secret Recipe Products\") and other designated and approved products; standards and procedures for business operations, including \"green\" design, construction, and operating practices; equipment layouts, graphics packages and signage, distinctive interior and exterior design and accessories, quality and uniformity of products and services offered; procedures for management and inventory control; training and assistance; advertising and promotional programs; and customer development and service techniques. These are not necessarily all of the elements of the System. We may change, improve, add to, delete from, and further develop the elements of the System from time to time. C. We identify the businesses operating under the System by means of the \"Pizza Fusion\" name and certain other trademarks, service marks, trade names, signs, logos, and other indicia of origin (collectively, the \"Proprietary Marks\"). We may designate other trade names, service marks, and trademarks (and also periodically delete old names and marks) as Proprietary Marks. D. You understand the importance of our high standards of quality, appearance, and service and the necessity of operating your Franchised Business in accordance with this Agreement and our standards, specifications and procedures. Therefore, the parties, who each intend to be legally bound by this Agreement, and for good and valuable consideration, now agree as follows: Page 1 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n1. RIGHTS GRANTED 1.1. Grant of Franchise. 1.1.1 We grant you the right, and you accept the obligation, to use the Proprietary Marks and the System to operate one Restaurant (the \"Franchised Business\") at the Premises, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The term \"Premises\" means the location shown on the cover page to this Agreement or a location that is determined under process set out in Section 4.1 [Site Selection and Approval] below. 1.1.2 Your rights under this Agreement have limits, such as the following: (a) You have no right to operate the Franchised Business at any location other than the Premises, as described in Section 1.2 [Activities of Franchised Business] below; (b) You have no right to sublicense either the Proprietary Marks or the System to anyone else; and (c) You have no right to use the Proprietary Marks or the System in any manner except as expressly authorized under this Agreement. 1.2. Activities of Franchised Business. 1.2.1 You may operate the Franchised Business only from the Premises, only in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and the procedures and terms and conditions set forth in the Pizza Fusion Manuals, and only to sell Products to: (a) retail customers for consumption on the Premises or for personal, carry out consumption; and (b) catering and delivery customers who are located within the area specified in Exhibit A as the \"Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area\". We may specify terms and conditions for catering and delivery activities, which may include guidelines and requirements relating to insurance coverage, vehicle use in such activities, and use of a third party phone order processing center as we may require. Without our prior written approval, you may not engage in any other type of sale, including, but not limited to: selling, distributing, or otherwise providing, any services or products to third parties at wholesale, or for resale or distribution by any third party; and selling, distributing or otherwise providing any products and/or services through catalogs, mail order, toll free numbers for delivery, or electronic means (e.g., the Internet). You acknowledge and agree that the sole purpose of the Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area is to specify the geographic area in which you will be authorized to provide catering and delivery services and conduct advertising under the terms of this Agreement, and that the designation of the Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area does not grant, and will not be implied to grant, any territorial rights or protections to you or the Franchised Business, and we reserve all other rights as set forth in Section 1.3 [Our Limitations and Our Reserved Rights] below. 1.2.2 You may advertise and market the Franchised Business and directly solicit customers only within your Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area (subject to Section 9.3 [Regional Fund] below). You agree not to: (a) advertise or market the services of your Franchised Business outside of the Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area; and/or (b) engage in direct solicitation of customers outside of the Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area. The term \"direct solicitation\" includes, but is not limited to, solicitation in person, by telephone, by mail, by e-mail, the internet, or other electronic means, advertising, marketing, and by distribution of brochures, business cards or other materials. 1.2.3. If any of your advertising within the Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area is in media that will or may reach a significant number of persons outside of the Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area, you must notify us in advance and obtain our prior written consent (in addition to the requirements in Section 9.3 [Regional Fund] below). We may periodically establish rules and policies regarding such advertising. Page 2 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3. Our Limitations and Our Reserved Rights. The rights granted to you under this Agreement are not exclusive. We and our affiliates have the right to conduct any business activities, under any name, and at (or from) any location notwithstanding those business activities' actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business. For example, we may, among other things, on any terms and conditions we deem advisable, and without granting you any rights therein, do any or all of the following: 1.3.1 We have the right to establish, and license others to establish, Franchised Businesses at any location notwithstanding their proximity to the Franchised Business or the Premises or their actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business. 1.3.2 We have the right to establish, and license others to establish, businesses under other systems or other proprietary marks, which businesses may offer or sell products and services that are different from the principal products and services offered from the Franchised Business, and which businesses may be located within or outside the Premises, notwithstanding such business' proximity to the Franchised Business or the Premises or their actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business. 1.3.3 We have the right to acquire and operate any business of any kind or be acquired by another business, notwithstanding such business' actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business. 1.3.4 We have the right to establish, and license others to establish, Restaurants at any Institutional Facility (as defined below), notwithstanding such Restaurants' proximity to the Franchised Business or their actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business. The term \"Institutional Facility\" is agreed to mean any outlet that primarily serves the customers located within the facility, such as captive audience facilities and limited purpose or limited access facilities, and includes among other things: airports; train or bus stations; travel plazas; factories; federal, state or local government facilities (including military bases); hospitals and other health-care facilities; stadiums and arenas; recreational facilities; schools, colleges and other academic facilities; convention centers; seasonal facilities; shopping malls; theaters; museums; and workplace cafeterias. 1.3.5 We have the right to sell and distribute, directly or indirectly, through any channels of distribution (including, but not limited to, supermarkets, gourmet shops, mail order, and on the internet) any products or services (including products and services that are the same or similar to those offered by Restaurants and using the Pizza Fusion name), from any location or to any purchaser or customer, advertise in any area (including in your Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area) and/or serve customers who reside within your Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area. You acknowledge that customers have total freedom to select the Pizza Fusion Restaurant that they wish to patronize. 1.3.6 We have the right to provide, and license others to provide, products or services to Major Accounts (as that term is defined below) at any location, notwithstanding such Major Accounts' proximity to the Franchised Business or the Premises or their actual or threatened impact on sales at the Franchised Business. The term \"Major Account\" is agreed to mean any customer we designate as such, based upon our sole determination that, because such customer conducts its business at multiple locations and we deem this customer to be of strategic importance, the account, services and pricing of such customer shall be negotiated and secured either (i) by us or (ii) with our assistance, approval and oversight; as further described in Section 6.12 [Major Accounts] below. 1.4. Limitations. You agree not to engage in any of the sales activities that we have reserved to ourselves in Sections 1.3 [Our Limitations and Our Reserved Rights] above.

This Agreement expires ten (10) years from the Agreement Date (the \"Term\"), unless it is terminated sooner as provided in other sections of this Agreement. 2.2. Successor Franchise Agreements. When this Agreement expires, you will have the option to continue the franchise relationship with us for two (2) additional terms of ten (10) years each. We may require you to satisfy any or all of the following as a condition of continuing the franchise relationship with us: 2.2.1. You must give us written notice of your desire to exercise your option not more than twelve (12) months and not less than nine (9) months before this Agreement expires. 2.2.2. You and all Owners must execute the standard form of Pizza Fusion Franchise Agreement that we are then offering to new franchisees (or the standard form that we most recently offered to new franchisees, if we are not at that time actively offering new franchises) (the \"Successor Franchise Agreement\"). The terms of the Successor Franchise Agreement may be substantially different from the terms of this Agreement and may require the payment of different fees. 2.2.3. You must pay all amounts owed to us, to our affiliates, and to your major suppliers; you must not be in default of this Agreement or any other agreement with us, our affiliates, or our suppliers; and you must have substantially and timely complied with all of your obligations throughout the term of each such agreement. 2.2.4. If we inspect your Franchised Business and give you notice at least six months before the end of the term of any required maintenance, refurbishing, renovating, and upgrading (including purchasing one or more new delivery vehicles); then you must complete all such required maintenance, refurbishing, renovating, and upgrading to our reasonable satisfaction no later than 60 days before expiration of the term. 2.2.5. You must pay us a discounted successor franchise fee in the amount of $7,500 or twenty-five percent (25%) of our then- current initial franchise fee (whichever is more). 2.2.6. You and all of your Owners must execute and deliver to us a general release, in a form we require, of any and all claims against us, our affiliates, and our past, present and future officers, directors, shareholders and employees arising out of or relating to your Franchised Business. 2.2.7. You, the Operating Principal, and/or your designated employees must successfully complete any additional or refresher training courses that we may require. 3. FEES 3.1. Initial Franchise Fee. You must pay us an initial franchise fee of $30,000 when you sign this Agreement. The initial franchise fee is paid in consideration of the rights granted in Section 1 and is fully earned at the time paid. You acknowledge that we have no obligation to refund the initial franchise fee in whole or in part for any reason. 3.2. Royalty 3.2.1. You must pay us a royalty fee (\"Royalty\") equal to six percent (6%) of your Gross Revenues. The Royalty is in consideration of your right to use the Proprietary Marks and the System in accordance with this Agreement, and not in exchange for any specific services we render. If by reason of state or other law, we are prohibited from receiving a percentage of certain components of Gross Revenues (including alcoholic-beverage sales), you must pay us an equivalent amount by increasing the Royalty percentage applied to Gross Revenues exclusive of the prohibited components. Page 4 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2. You must calculate and pay the Royalty weekly, based on your Gross Revenues for the previous Period. For purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise designated by us in writing, a \"Period\" begins on Monday and ends on the following Sunday. 3.2.3. \"Gross Revenues\" means all revenue from the sale of all services and products and all other income of every kind and nature related to, derived from, or originating from the Franchised Business, including proceeds of any business interruption insurance policies, whether for cash or credit, and regardless of collection in the case of credit; provided, however, that \"Gross Revenues\" does not include any coupon sales (for which customers do not pay for product), customer refunds, sales taxes or other taxes you collected from customers and actually transmitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. 3.3. Advertising Contributions. During any Period that the Marketing Fund (as defined in Section 9.1 [Pizza Fusion Marketing Fund] below) is in effect, you must make a contribution as described in Section 9.1 [Pizza Fusion Marketing Fund] below equal to three percent (3%) of your Gross Revenues for the preceding Period. Additionally, during any Period that a Regional Fund (as defined in Section 9.3 [Regional Fund] below) for the area in which your Franchised Business is located is in effect, you must make a contribution as described in Section 9.2 [Local Marketing] below in such amounts as we specify in writing up to two percent (2%) of your Gross Revenues for the preceding Period; in addition, you may be required to contribute to a Regional Fund up to an additional two percent (2%) of Gross Revenues of your Franchised Business if the members of that Regional Fund vote to increase the total contribution, as provided in Section 9.3.5 [Regional Fund] below. Required contributions to the Marketing Fund and Regional Fund are referred to as \"Advertising Contributions.\" 3.4. Index. The parties agree that all fixed dollar amounts set out in this Agreement are subject to adjustment, up or down, depending on changes in the Index. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term \"Index\" is agreed to mean the Consumer Price Index (1982-84=100: all items; CPI- U; all urban consumers) published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (or if the Index is no longer published, a successor index that we may reasonably specify in the Manuals or otherwise in writing). We have the right to decide whether or not to make adjustments to fixed dollar amounts set out in this Agreement and if we decide to invoke that right, we will make changes not more than once each year by sending you written notice of the change. 3.5. Due Date for Payment. Your Royalty payments and Advertising Contributions are due by the first (1st) day after the end of each Period (or the next business day if the first day is a Sunday or federal holiday) (as of the Agreement Date, the due date is Monday of each week). You must pay all other amounts due to us as specified in this Agreement or, if no time is specified, such amounts are due upon receipt of an invoice from us. 3.6. Method of Payment. You must make all payments to us by the method or methods that we specify from time to time. We require payment via wire transfer or electronic debit to your bank account, and you must maintain sufficient balance in your operating account to meet the payment requirements. You must furnish us and your bank with all authorizations necessary to effect payment by the methods we specify. You may not, under any circumstances, set off, deduct or otherwise withhold any Royalty fees, Advertising Contributions, interest charges, or any other monies payable under this Agreement on grounds of our alleged non-performance of any obligations. Additionally, you authorize us to charge against any of your credit cards any amounts due to us or to any of our affiliates. You agree to supply us a written list of all of your credit cards (including card number, name, and expiration date) and to update that list periodically, if there are changes to the information. Page 5 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7. Delinquency. If any Royalties or other amounts owed to us are not paid in full by the due date, we have the right to charge interest on the overdue amount at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, if less than 1.5%) from the date such amount was due until paid in full. Unpaid interest charges will compound annually. In addition, we will have the right to charge a late fee for each occurrence of a payment that is more than 30 days past due, which fee will be $100 for the first such occurrence, $200 for the second such occurrence, and $300 for the third and each subsequent occurrence during the Term of this Agreement. The late fee is to compensate us for our administrative costs incurred in enforcing your obligation to pay us. 3.8. Dishonored Payments. For any amount that you must pay to us or our affiliates, if we are not able to successfully complete a wire transfer or electronic debit for such payment as described Section 3.6 [Method of Payment] above, or if a check that you issue for such payment is returned by the bank against which it was drawn, due to insufficient funds in your account(s), closure of your account(s) or any other reason resulting in the nonpayment (each a \"Dishonored Payment\"), we have the right to charge a fee of $100 per occurrence (a \"Dishonored Payment Charge\"). We will notify you of each Dishonored Payment and any Dishonored Payment Charge that we impose. We may add the Dishonored Payment Charge to the amount to be paid via the next wire transfer or electronic debit. The Dishonored Payment Charge applies in addition to any late fee and interest that we have the right to charge, or any other remedy to which we are entitled, under this Agreement, at law, or in equity. 3.9 Taxes. You are responsible for all taxes levied or assessed on you or the Franchised Business in connection with your activities under this Agreement. 3.10 Obligations Absolute. You agree that your obligations to pay us (as well as our affiliates) under this Agreement or any other agreement in connection to the Franchised Business are absolute and unconditional, and not subject to abatement or setoff for past or future claims that you may assert. 3.11 Security Agreement. Upon our written request, you agree to grant to us a first-priority security interest in all of your assets (including all proceeds thereof and after-acquired property), as security for all your monetary and other obligations to us or our affiliates arising under or relating to this Agreement or any other agreement. Such assets include all furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, inventory and all other property, (tangible or intangible), that you now own or later acquire, used in connection with the Franchised Business, and wheresoever located as well as all contractual and related rights you have under this Agreement and all other agreements between the parties. If we request, you must execute such financing statements, continuation statements, notices of lien, assignments or other documents as we may require in order to perfect and maintain our security interest, including but not limited to a UCC-1 Financing Statement. Alternatively, you authorize us to execute any of the foregoing financing statements, continuation statements, notices of lien, assignments, and/or other documents on your behalf, or on our own (in our name), describing the collateral in such manner as we consider appropriate. You hereby grant us an irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an interest, to execute, in your name, any of such financing statements, continuation statements, notices of lien, assignments or other documents. You must pay all filing fees and costs for perfecting our security interest. 4. SITE SELECTION, PREPARATION, AND OPENING DEADLINE 4.1. Site Selection and Approval. You will be responsible, at your own expense, for finding and then acquiring, by lease or purchase, a suitable site at which to develop and operate your Franchised Business (the \"Premises\"). Any sites that you propose must be within the area identified in Exhibit A (the \"Site Selection Area\"). You acknowledge and agree that: (a) the sole purpose of designating a Site Selection Area is to identify the geographic area in which you intend (and, upon our written approval, will be authorized) to operate a Franchised Business under the terms of this Agreement; (b) the designation of the Site Selection Area does not grant, and will not be implied to grant, any territorial rights or protections to you or to the Franchised Business; and (c) we reserve all rights as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, including but not limited to those described in Section 1.3 [Our Limitations and Our Reserved Rights] above. Before committing to a site, you must obtain our written approval of the site to serve as the Premises, as described in Section 4.2 [Site Lease or Acquisition] below. Page 6 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1. We will give you certain assistance in connection with your selection of Premises and establishment of your Franchised Business: (a) We will provide to you a copy of our standard site selection criteria and guidelines, including our minimum standards for Franchised Businesses. (b) We will have the right to provide to you the degree of site selection counseling and assistance that we deem appropriate. If we (either on our own initiative or at your request) consider on-site evaluation necessary or appropriate, you agree to reimburse us for the reasonable expenses that we incur in connection with providing that on-site evaluation (including the cost of travel, lodging and meals). (c) We will provide, at no charge, our standard image specifications for the construction of the Franchised Business, improvement of the premises, and for the layout of fixtures, furnishings, equipment, and signs. On or before the date you open the Franchised Business, you must return to us the plans and specifications we provided to you (and any copies that you may have made or shared with other parties). 4.1.2 You must submit a site review report and such other information or materials as we may reasonably require (including but not limited to, photographs, demographic information, an option contract, letter of intent, or other evidence satisfactory to us that confirms your favorable prospects for obtaining the site). We will review site approval submissions on a first-in basis. (a) If we do not approve in writing the proposed site, you must, within 30 days after our disapproval of the proposed site, submit a new proposed site within the Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area for our review and approval. (b) By no later than 90 days after the Agreement Date, you must have obtained our written approval of a site. If you have not done so, we may elect to terminate this Agreement, and we will not refund to you the Initial Franchise Fee or any other money paid to us.

We will not unreasonably withhold our approval of special plans and specifications, prepared at your expense, when the Approved Location will not accommodate our standard plans and specifications, provided that such plans and specifications conform to our general design criteria. You will be responsible for the design and layout that your architect or engineer prepares. If we express an opinion about the plans or indicate our approval, it will be merely for the purpose of our own determination that your plans will satisfy our internal standards, specifications, and layout. We will not be in a position to provide any assurances, and therefore can not be deemed to have given any information about, whether your plans satisfy any federal, state, and local laws, codes and regulations (including, without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\")).

Any reviews that we conduct under this Section 4 are only for our benefit. You acknowledge that our review and approval of a site, lease, sublease, design plans or renovation plans for a Franchised Business do not constitute a recommendation, endorsement, or guarantee of the suitability of that location or the terms of the lease, or sublease, or purchase agreement. You agree that you will take all steps necessary to determine for yourself whether a particular location and the terms of any lease, sublease, or purchase agreement for the site are beneficial and acceptable to you. 4.5 Opening Deadline. You must begin operating the Franchised Business by the opening deadline specified in Appendix A. The date you actually open the Franchised Business is the \"Opening Date.\" 4.6 Relocation and other Uses of the Premises. You may not relocate the Franchised Business from the Premises without our prior written consent. You may only use the Premises for the purpose of operating your Franchised Business and for no other purpose. You may not sublet or otherwise allow any other party to operate any enterprise at your Premises without our prior written approval. 5. TRAINING 5.1. Initial Training Program 5.1.1. Before you begin operating, the two persons who you designate (and who we find acceptable) to provide managerial responsibilities (each a \"Manager Trainee\") must all successfully attend (at the same time) and successfully complete our initial training program (we may designate portions of the training program that each person must attend and successfully complete), which is held at our headquarters and/or another location(s) that we specify. One Manager Trainee must be your Operating Principal (who meets the criteria in Section 6.15 of this Agreement), unless we mutually agree otherwise. You may designate another person who will be active in the day-to-day activities and management of the Franchised Business to be the second Manager Trainee. You may ask that additional employees be allowed to attend the portions of the initial training that are designed for your employees, and we will have the right to approve or disapprove that request. All trainees must be persons that we find acceptable at all times to serve in their respective capacities. As of the Effective Date, our training program has two components, as follows: (a) An Advanced Operations Course for your Operating Principal, which consists of up to twelve days for your Operating Principal and is conducted at our training facilities in Broward County, Florida, or at another location that we may specify in writing. (b) A Basic Operations Course for any Manager Trainee other than your Operating Principal, which consists of up to twelve days of training and is conducted at our training facilities in Broward County, Florida, or at another location that we may specify in writing. Your Manager Trainees (other than your Operating Principal), and such of the Franchisee's other employees as we designate must attend this component of training. 5.1.2. We will issue a certificate of completion for each Manager Trainee who completes the initial training program we require to our satisfaction (each such person will be referred to as a \"Certified Manager\"). We have the right to determine whether a person has or has not successfully completed training. If you (or your personnel) fail to complete initial training to our satisfaction, we may permit you (or they) to repeat the course or allow you to send a substitute to the next available scheduled training session; however, we will have no obligation to extend the opening deadline in Section 4 for this purpose. Page 10 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3. We have the right to reduce the duration or content of the training program for any trainee who has prior experience with our concept or in similar businesses. We also may allow you to train certain of your managers (which may include Certified Managers) and successors in those positions at your location. 5.1.4. Failure to complete the initial training program constitutes grounds for termination, as provided in Section 15 of this Agreement. 5.2. Opening Training and Assistance. We provide up to fourteen (14) days of pre-opening training and opening assistance at your Premises. The Operating Principal and the other Manager Trainee and such of your other employees as we designate must attend this component of training, which will begin approximately seven days before the Opening Date and conclude approximately seven days thereafter. 5.3. Additional Training by Us. We may require your Certified Managers and/or other designated persons to successfully complete additional training courses during the Term of this Agreement at a location that we specify (including an annual conference for franchisees in the System). We may also offer optional training programs. You may also request that we provide additional training at the location of your Franchised Business, and we will provide such training if we determine that we are able to do so. We may charge you a training fee and our out-of-pocket expenses for all additional training programs, whether mandatory or optional, or whether you request or we require such training, which fee shall be as set forth in the Manual or otherwise in writing. 5.4. Training by You. We have the right to specify training programs related to the System that you must conduct for your employees using approved training materials or that we will provide at our headquarters. For any training of your personnel that we conduct, you are responsible for expenses incurred while they attend training, including salaries, benefits, travel, lodging, meals, and other related expenses. We reserve the right to charge you for training additional personnel. 5.5. Training Materials and Methods. All training materials that we provide to you remain our property. We have the right to provide training programs in person, on tape, via the Internet or other electronic means, or by other means and media, as we determine. 5.6. Expenses. We will provide instructors, facilities, and materials for the initial training program at no charge, provided that all of your personnel are trained during the same training session. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for training additional personnel (in excess of two), re-training persons who are repeating the course or replacing a person who did not pass. For all training, including initial training, you are responsible for any travel expenses, living expenses, wages, and other expenses incurred by your trainees. 6. OPERATIONS 6.1. Compliance with Standards. You agree to comply with all mandatory specifications and procedures set forth from time to time in our confidential operating manual (the \"Manual\"). You acknowledge that the accounting practices, record keeping, software, services, and operation of your Franchised Business are important to us and our other franchisees. However, you acknowledge that we have the right to vary our standards and specifications, in our reasonable judgment, to accommodate circumstances of individual franchisees. 6.2. Products and Services You May Offer. You may offer customers only the products and services that we have expressly authorized Franchised Businesses to offer, as we have the right to specify in the Manual from time to time. We have the right to change the authorized products and services, and we may designate specific products or services as optional or mandatory (including alcoholic beverages). You acknowledge that we may approve some services, products, and other items for certain franchisees and not others based on legitimate business reasons. You must use menus that meet our then-current specifications as to content, materials, finish, style, pattern, and design.

The Secret Recipe Products are our proprietary products. In order to maintain the high standards of quality, taste, and uniformity of these products and protect the proprietary nature of these products, you agree to purchase the Secret Recipe Products only from us, our affiliates or from sources that we designate or approve and license 6.4 Sourcing of Other Products, Equipment and Supplies. 6.4.1. Without limiting Section 6.3 [Secret Recipe Products] above, we have the right to require that all of the food items, equipment (including but not limited to vehicles used in connection with the Franchised Business), supplies, materials, and other products and services used or offered for sale at your Franchised Business: (a) meet specifications that we establish from time to time; and/or (b) be purchased only from suppliers that we have expressly approved; and/or (c) be purchased only from a single source (which may include us or our affiliates or a buying cooperative that we organize). To the extent that we establish specifications, require approval of suppliers, or designate specific suppliers for particular items, we will publish our requirements in the Manual. 6.4.2. If you would like to use or offer food items (other than the Secret Recipe Products), equipment, supplies, materials, and other products and services that we have not approved, or purchase from a vendor, supplier, distributor, or other source (together, \"supplier(s)\") that we have not approved, then you must submit to us a written request for approval. We have the ongoing right to inspect any proposed supplier's facilities and to test samples of the proposed products or services. You agree to pay us an amount not to exceed the reasonable cost of the inspection and our actual cost of testing the proposed product or service, including personnel and travel costs, whether or not we ultimately approve the supplier. We have the right to grant, deny, or revoke approval of products, services, and suppliers. We will notify you in writing of our decision as soon as practicable following our evaluation. We reserve the right to reinspect the facilities and products of any approved supplier and to revoke approval if we find that the supplier fails to meet any of our then-current criteria. If you receive a notice of revocation of approval, you agree to immediately stop buying products or services from the disapproved supplier and, in the case of revocation based on failure of products to meet our standards, you agree to dispose of your remaining inventory of the disapproved supplier's products as we direct. 6.4.3. If you wish to test market an item that we have not approved, then, so long as we have given you our prior written approval, you may do so for so long, and on such terms, that we mutually agree upon (a \"Test\"), and the item so tested, and all associated formulae, plans, and materials, will become our property. If, following the Test, we determine that we will approve the tested item, then for so long as we deem that item to be an \"approved item\" under this Agreement, you will have the right to use that item under the terms of this Agreement; and we will have the right to use and market that item as we see fit, including but not limited to use in our own Restaurants as well as that of other licensees and franchisees, without compensation to you. You agree to sign such documents (and require your employees and any independent contractors that you have engaged to sign such documents) as we may require in order to implement the provisions of this Section 6.4.3 [Sourcing of Other Products, Equipment and Supplies]. 6.4.4. We and our affiliates may receive payments or other compensation from suppliers on account of such suppliers' dealings with you and other franchisees; and, we may use all amounts so received for any purpose we and our affiliates deem appropriate. 6.5. Delivery Vehicles. If you wish to use a vehicle to provide delivery services (a \"Delivery Vehicle\") as part of your Franchised Business, you must comply with the specifications and standards that we may periodically prescribe in the Manuals for Delivery Vehicles. Our specifications and standards may include, among other things: designating Delivery Vehicles specific make and model; limitations on the Useful Life for a Delivery Vehicle and standards for maintenance or repair services.

The term \"Useful Life\" means the period of time after which you must stop using the Delivery Vehicle for the Franchised Business. We have the right to determine the Useful Life of any Delivery Vehicle, which may include reasonable standards as to how many model years old the vehicle may be, the appearance of the vehicle, and the performance of the vehicle. After the Useful Life, you must remove all Proprietary Marks and any other indicia associating the Delivery Vehicle with the System, and immediately purchase or lease a new Delivery Vehicle. 6.5.2. We have the right to specify the makes and models of Delivery Vehicles approved for use by our franchisees, and anticipate that we will make changes over time to reflect and take advantage of advances in technology and/or alternative energy powered vehicles. 6.6.

As noted in Section 1.3 [Our Limitations and Our Reserved Rights] above, we reserve the right to provide products and services to all Major Accounts. We may offer you the right to provide products and services to a Major Account within your Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area. If you accept the obligation to provide products and services to a Major Account, you must service such Major Account on our behalf, in accordance with the pricing and other terms that we negotiate with the Major Account customer. You may not enter into any relationship with a Major Account customer that we deem to conflict with the customer's Major Account arrangement with us.

Certain Major Account customers may require that we provide additional volume rebates, which we will negotiate with the customer on a case-by-case basis.

TRANSFERS BY US We have the unrestricted right to transfer or assign all or any part of our rights and/or our obligations under this Agreement to any person or legal entity without your consent. You agree that we will have no liability after the effective date of transfer or assignment for the performance of, or for any failure to perform, any obligations we have transferred. We also have the absolute right to delegate to others the performance of any of our duties, obligations, or benefits under this Agreement, to third parties (including, without limitation, an area developer under the terms of an area development agreement with us), which will not be parties to an agreement with you. 14. TRANSFERS BY YOU 14.1. Definition of Transfer. In this Agreement, \"Transfer\" as a verb means to sell, assign, give away, pledge, or encumber, either voluntarily or by operation of law (such as through divorce or bankruptcy proceedings), any interest in this Agreement the rights and/or obligations under this Agreement, all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business, and/or any direct or indirect interest in the ownership of Franchisee (if the Franchisee is a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company). \"Transfer\" as a noun means any such sale, assignment, etc. 14.2. No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent. Neither you nor any of the Owners may make any Transfer or permit any Transfer to occur without obtaining our prior written consent. We have the right to withhold our consent, except as otherwise provided in Sections 14.3 [Transfer of Entire Business] through 14.8 [Our Right of First Refusal]. We have the right to communicate with and counsel both you and the proposed transferee on any aspect of a proposed Transfer. If a Transfer requires our consent, then that transaction may not take place until at least sixty (60) days after we receive written notice of the proposed Transfer. You agree to provide any information and documentation relating to the proposed Transfer that we reasonably require. Unless otherwise agreed, we do not waive any claims against the transferring party if we approve the Transfer. 14.3. Transfer of Entire Business. For a proposed Transfer of the Franchised Business or this Agreement (or, if Franchisee is a corporation or other entity, a Transfer of ownership interests that would result in a change of control of Franchisee), the following conditions apply (unless waived by us): 14.3.1. You must be in compliance with all obligations to us under this Agreement and any other agreement you have with us and our affiliates as of the date of the request for our approval of the Transfer, or you must make arrangements satisfactory to us to come into compliance by the date of the Transfer. 14.3.2. The proposed transferee must complete all of the following requirements: (a) Demonstrate to our satisfaction that he or she meets all of our then-current qualifications to become a Pizza Fusion franchisee, and, at our request, the proposed transferee must travel (at his or her expense) to our principal office for an interview. (b) Sign our then-current standard form of franchise agreement (or the standard form most recently offered to new franchisees, if we are not then offering franchises to new franchisees) for the then-remaining balance of the Term of this Agreement, and such other ancillary agreements we require for new Franchised Businesses. Their new franchise agreement may materially differ from the terms of this Agreement. (c) Successfully complete our then-current training requirements and pay the then-current fee for training. (d) If the proposed transferee is one of our other franchisees, he or she must not be in default under his or her agreements with us and must have a good record of customer service and compliance with our operating standards. (e) If the transferee is a corporation or other entity, the owner or owners of a beneficial interest in the transferee must execute our then-current form of personal guarantee. Page 27 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n14.3.3. You or the transferee must make arrangements to modernize, upgrade, and conform the Franchised Business, at your and/or the transferee's expense, to our then-current standards and specifications for new Franchised Businesses. 14.3.4. We must be paid, either by you or the transferee, a transfer fee (\"Transfer Fee\") in an amount equal to $7,500 (or twenty- five percent (25%) of the then-current initial franchise fee, if greater). The payment of this transfer fee is in place of any initial franchise fee due under the Franchise Agreement the transferee will enter under Section 14.3.2 [Transfer of Entire Business] above. If the transferee is a spouse, son, or daughter of the transferor and the transfer is for estate-planning purposes, no transfer fee is charged, but the transferor must reimburse us for the out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees) we incur in connection with reviewing, approving, and properly documenting the transfer. 14.3.5. You and all Owners must execute a general release, in a form satisfactory to us, of all claims against us and our past, present and future affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents and employees. You and the Owners will remain liable to us for all obligations arising before the effective date of the Transfer. 14.3.6. The price and other proposed terms of the Transfer must not, in our reasonable business judgment, have the effect of negatively impacting the future viability of the Franchised Business. 14.4. Transfer of a Partial Ownership Interest. For any proposal to admit a new Owner, to remove an existing Owner, or to change the distribution of ownership shown on the cover page, or for any other transaction that amounts to the Transfer of a partial interest in the Franchised Business, you must give us advance notice and submit a copy of all proposed contracts and other information concerning the Transfer that we may request. We will have the right to require reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses that we incur in reviewing the proposed Transfer. We will have a reasonable time (not less than thirty (30) days) after we have received all requested information to evaluate the proposed Transfer. You must satisfy the conditions in Sections 8.6, 14.3.2(a) [Transfer of Entire Business], 14.3.4 [Transfer of Entire Business], 14.3.5 [Transfer of Entire Business], and 14.3.6 [Transfer of Entire Business] above in connection with any such transfer. We may withhold our consent on any reasonable grounds or give our consent subject to reasonable conditions. You acknowledge that any proposed new owner must submit a personal application and execute a personal guarantee in the same form signed by the original Owners. 14.5. Transfer to a Corporation or Other Entity. We will consent to the assignment of this Agreement to a corporation, partnership or limited liability corporation that you form for the convenience of ownership, provided that: (a) the entity has and will have no other business besides operating a Franchised Business (b) you satisfy the conditions in Sections 14.3.2(a) [Transfer of Entire Business], 14.3.3 [Transfer of Entire Business], 14.3.4 [Transfer of Entire Business] and 14.3.5 [Transfer of Entire Business] above; and (c) the Owners hold equity interests in the new entity in the same proportion shown on the cover page. There is no Transfer Fee for a Transfer to a corporation for convenience of ownership. 14.6. Transfer upon Death or Incapacity. If you or any Owner dies, becomes incapacitated, or enters bankruptcy proceedings, that person's executor, administrator, personal representative, or trustee must apply to us in writing within three (3) months after the event (death, declaration of incapacity, or filing of a bankruptcy petition) for consent to Transfer the person's interest. The Transfer will be subject to the provisions of Sections 14.2 [No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent] through 14.8 [Our Right of First Refusal], as applicable, except there will be no Transfer Fee. In addition, if the deceased or incapacitated person is the Operating Principal, you must within 30 days thereafter, hire and retain a replacement, who is satisfactory to us, to perform such obligations. If a satisfactory replacement is not retained, we will have the right (but not the obligation) to take over operation of the Franchised Business, or to hire and retain a replacement on your behalf, until the Transfer is completed and to charge a reasonable management fee for these services. For purposes of this Section, \"incapacity\" means any physical or mental infirmity that will prevent the person from performing his or her obligations under this Agreement: (i) for a period of thirty (30) or more consecutive days; or (ii) for sixty (60) or more total days during a calendar year. In the case of Transfer by bequest or by intestate succession, if the heirs or beneficiaries are unable to meet the conditions of Section 14.3 [Transfer of Entire Business], the executor may transfer the decedent's interest to another successor that we have approved, subject to all of the terms and conditions for Transfers contained in this Agreement. If an interest is not disposed of under this Section 14.6 [Transfer upon Death or Incapacity] within six (6) months after the date of death or appointment of a personal representative or trustee, we may terminate this Agreement under Section 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period] below. Page 28 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n14.7. Non-Conforming Transfers. Any purported Transfer that is not in compliance with this Section 14 is null and void and constitutes a material breach of this Agreement, for which we may terminate this Agreement without opportunity to cure. Our consent to a Transfer does not constitute a waiver of any claims that we have against the transferor, nor is it a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 14.8. Our Right of First Refusal. We have the right, exercisable within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice specified in Section 14.2 [No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent], to send written notice to you that we intend to purchase the interest proposed to be Transferred. We may assign our right of first refusal to someone else either before or after we exercise it. However, our right of first refusal will not apply with regard to a Transfer under Section 14.5 [Transfer to a Corporation or Other Entity] or a Transfer to your parents, spouse, son, daughter, or mother or father in-law (including Transfers to your parents, spouse, son, daughter, or mother or father in-law as a result of death or incapacity as described in Section 14.6 [Transfer upon Death or Incapacity]). 14.8.1. If the Transfer is proposed to be made pursuant to a sale, we or our designee may purchase the interest proposed to be Transferred on the same economic terms and conditions offered by the third-party. Closing on our purchase must occur by the later of (a) 60 days after the date of our notice to the seller electing to purchase the interest, or (b) the closing date as proposed in the third-party's purchase offer. If we cannot reasonably be expected to furnish the same consideration as the third-party, then we may substitute the reasonable equivalent in cash. If the parties cannot agree within 30 days on the reasonable equivalent in cash, we will designate, at our expense, an independent appraiser and the appraiser's determination will be final. Any material change in the terms of the offer from a third-party after we have elected not to purchase the seller's interest will constitute a new offer subject to the same right of first refusal as the third party's initial offer. 14.8.2. If a Transfer is proposed to be made by gift, we will designate, at our expense, an independent appraiser to determine the fair market value of the interest proposed to be transferred. We may purchase the interest at the fair market value determined by the appraiser. Closing on the purchase will occur within 30 days after our notice to the transferor of the appraiser's determination of fair market value. 14.8.3. If we elect not to exercise our rights under this Section, the transferor may complete the Transfer after complying with Sections 14.2 [No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent] through 14.6 [Transfer upon Death or Incapacity] above. Closing of the Transfer must occur within 60 calendar days of our election (or such longer period as applicable law may require); otherwise, the third-party's offer will be treated as a new offer subject to our right of first refusal. The Transfer is conditional upon our determination that the Transfer was on terms substantially the same as those offered to us. 15. TERMINATION 15.1. Termination By Us Without Notice. You will be in default under this Agreement and all rights granted by this Agreement will automatically terminate without notice to you if you become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of your creditors; if a receiver is appointed; if execution is levied against your business assets; or if suit to foreclose any lien or mortgage or bankruptcy is instituted against you and not dismissed within 60 days.

We may terminate this Agreement by written notice to you, without giving you an opportunity to cure, upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 15.2.1. You, the Operating Principal, and/or your personnel fail to complete training under Section 5.1 [Initial Training Program] to our satisfaction. 15.2.2. You fail to open for business by the opening deadline specified in Appendix A. 15.2.3. You disclose the contents of the Manual or other trade secrets or confidential information contrary to Sections 11 and 12 of this Agreement. 15.2.4. You refuse to permit, or try to hinder, an examination or audit of your books and records or of the Franchised Business as provided in this Agreement. 15.2.5. You make any material misrepresentation in connection with your application to us for the franchise, or you submit to us any report or statement that you know or should know to be false or misleading. 15.2.6. You understate to us your Gross Revenues, by 2% or more on three or more occasions in any twelve-month period, or by 5% or more for any period of four or more consecutive weeks. 15.2.7. You fail to operate the Franchised Business for three or more consecutive business days on which you were required to operate, unless we determine that the failure was beyond your control. 15.2.8. You or any Owner, officer or director is convicted of a crime that we reasonably believe is likely to harm the reputation of the Pizza Fusion concept. 15.2.9. Any Transfer occurs that does not comply with Section 14, including a failure to transfer to a qualified successor after death or disability within the time allowed by Section 14.7 [Non-Conforming Transfers]. 15.2.10. You are in default three (3) or more times under Sections 15.3 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for Monetary Default] and/or 15.4 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period] within any twelve (12) month period, whether or not the defaults are similar and whether or not they are cured. 15.2.11. After curing a default pursuant to Sections 15.3 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for Monetary Default] or 15.4 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period], you commit the same default within twelve (12) months, whether or not the second default is cured. 15.2.12. Any condition exists with respect to the Franchised Business that, in our reasonable judgment, seriously jeopardizes public health or safety. 15.2.13. You fail to comply with the covenants in Section 17 below or fail to timely obtain execution of the covenants required under Section 12 above and Section 17.3 [Owners and Employees] below. 15.2.14. You fail to obtain or maintain required insurance. 15.2.15. You cease to operate the Franchised Business for more than seven (7) consecutive days or fourteen (14) days in any calendar year unless we approved a temporary closing or we determine, that the failure to operate was beyond your control, you otherwise abandon the Franchised Business, or you lose the right to possess the Premises or you otherwise forfeit the right to do or transact business as required under this Agreement. If, however, through no fault of you, the Premises are damaged or destroyed by an event such that repairs or reconstruction cannot be completed within ninety (90) days thereafter, you will have thirty (30) days after such event in which to apply for our approval to relocate and/or reconstruct the premises, and we will not unreasonably hold our approval. Page 30 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n15.3. Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for Monetary Default. You will be in default under this Agreement if you fail, refuse, or neglect to pay when due (including if we are not able to collect payments by electronic fund transfer pursuant to Section 3.6 [Method of Payment] due to insufficient funds in your account(s), closure of your account(s), or any other reason resulting in the nonpayment) any monies owing to us, our affiliates, or any lender that has provided financing to you under this Agreement or any other agreement, or to your landlord and/or any supplier of goods or services to your Franchised Business. You will have ten (10) days after written notice of such default from us within which to remedy the default. You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the 10-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require). If you do not cure the default within such 10-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require), this Agreement will terminate automatically and without further notice, effective immediately upon the expiration of the specified time period. 15.4 Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period. For any default not covered under Sections 15.1 [Termination By Us Without Notice], 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period], or 15.3 above, you will have thirty (30) days after written notice of default from us within which to remedy the default. You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the 30-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require). If you do not cure the default within the specified time, this Agreement will terminate automatically and without further notice, effective immediately upon the expiration of the specified time period. Any failure to comply with this Agreement, as amended or reasonably supplemented by the Manual or otherwise in writing, not covered by Sections 15.1 [Termination By Us Without Notice], 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period], or 15.3 above constitutes a default, including, but not limited to, the following: 15.3.1. You fail, refuse, or neglect to submit to us the financial and other reports and information required under this Agreement. 15.3.2. You fail to comply with any of the mandatory standards or procedures prescribed by us in this Agreement, the Manual, or otherwise in writing. 15.3.3. You fail, refuse, or neglect to obtain our prior written approval or consent as required by this Agreement (other than a failure to obtain consent to a proposed Transfer, for which we may terminate without a cure period as provided in Section 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period]). 15.3.4. For a period of fifteen (15) days, you allow a continued violation of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation of a governmental agency, including the failure to maintain or procure any required licenses, permits, or certifications, in the absence of a good faith dispute over its application or legality and without promptly resorting to an appropriate administrative or judicial forum for relief. 15.3.5. You misuse or make any unauthorized use of the Proprietary Marks or otherwise materially impair our goodwill or rights in the Proprietary Marks. 15.5. Cross-Default. Any default by you (including for this purpose your affiliates) under any other agreement with us will constitute a default under this Agreement, subject to the same provisions for notice and cure, if any, as may be applicable to the default under the other agreement. 16. OBLIGATIONS ON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION 16.1. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, unless we direct you otherwise: 16.1.1. You agree to promptly pay all sums owing to us, our affiliates and suppliers, including, but not limited to, Royalty payments, contributions to the Marketing Fund, or other fees, damages, expenses, and attorney's fees incurred as a result of your default. Page 31 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n16.1.2. You agree to stop making any use of the confidential methods, procedures, and techniques associated with the System. You also agree to immediately deliver to us the Manual and all training materials, marketing materials, records, files, forms, instructions, signs, equipment, correspondence, copies, Customer Data, and other property in your possession or control that contain confidential information (as defined in Section 12) or that bear the Proprietary Marks and you agree not to retain any unauthorized copies of these materials. You also must deliver to us all customer information that you have compiled. 16.1.3. You agree to immediately cease to use, by advertising or in any other manner, the name \"Pizza Fusion,\" all other Proprietary Marks, and all other distinctive forms, slogans, signs, symbols, Websites, domain name, website, e-mail address, and any other identifier (whether or not we have authorized its use) that you used in connection with your operation of the Franchised Business or that are otherwise associated with the Proprietary Marks, System, and/or us. If you subsequently begin to operate another business, you agree that you will not use any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of the Proprietary Marks that you used either in connection with the Franchised Business or its promotion, which is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception, or which is likely to dilute our exclusive rights in and to the Proprietary Marks, nor any trade dress or designation of origin or description or representation which falsely suggests or represents an association or connection with us. 16.1.4. You agree to promptly take such action as may be necessary to cancel any assumed name registration or equivalent registration containing the name PIZZA FUSION or any other Proprietary Marks. 16.1.5 You will, at our option, assign to us any interest which you have in the lease or sublease for the Premises. (a) If we do not elect or are unable to exercise our option to acquire, or to acquire the lease or sublease for the Premises, you must make such modifications or alterations to the premises operated hereunder (including, without limitation, the changing of the telephone number) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to distinguish the appearance of the Premises from that of other Restaurants under the System, and such specific additional changes as we may reasonably request for that purpose. In addition, you must stop making any use of any telephone number and/or any domain name, website, e-mail address, and any other identifier (whether or not we have authorized its use) that you used in connection with your operation of the Franchised Business, and you must promptly execute such documents or take such steps necessary to remove reference to the Franchised Business from all trade or business telephone directories, including physical and online \"yellow\" and \"white\" pages, or at our request transfer same to us. (b) If you fail or refuse to comply with the requirements of this Section 16.1.5 [OBLIGATIONS ON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION], we will have the right to enter upon the Premises, without being guilty of trespass or any other tort, for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at your expense, which you agree to pay upon demand. 16.2. Purchase of Assets. You agree that, at our option, you will sell to us any or all your assets used to operate the Franchised Business (including equipment, fixtures, furnishings, Delivery Vehicles, supplies, and inventory) that we ask in writing to purchase. 16.2.1. The purchase price for such items will be equal to your depreciated cost (determined below) or fair market value, whichever is less. The cost will be determined based upon a five (5) year straight-line depreciation of original costs. For equipment that is five (5) or more years old, the parties agree that fair market value will be deemed to be ten percent (10%) of the equipment's original cost. The fair market value of tangible assets must be determined without reference to good will, going-concern value, or other intangible assets. Page 32 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.2. We may exercise this option by delivering a notice of intent to purchase to you within 30 days after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. During that 30-day period, you agree not to dispose of, transfer, or otherwise hinder our ability to exercise our rights with respect to your assets. 16.2.3. If we exercise our option to purchase, we may setoff all amounts due to us under this Agreement and the cost of the appraisal (if any), against any payment due to you. 16.2.4. If we do not exercise our rights to purchase your Delivery Vehicle(s), you must immediately make such modifications or alterations to the Delivery Vehicle(s) that may be needed to remove any Proprietary Marks and to otherwise distinguish the appearance of the vehicle(s) from those used by other Restaurants. 16.3. Right to Enter and Continue Operations. In order to preserve the goodwill of the System following termination, we (or our designee) have the right to enter the Premises (without liability to you, your Owners, or otherwise) for the purpose continuing the Franchised Business' operation and maintaining the goodwill of the business. 16.4. Liquidated Damages. If this Agreement is terminated due to your default, you must, upon written demand, pay us a lump-sum payment in an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average of your Royalty fees and Advertising Contributions due for the last 60 months before our delivery of notice of default (or, if lesser, the months you had been operating before our delivery of notice of default), (b) multiplied by the lesser of 60 or the number of months remaining in the term of this Agreement. 16.5. Liquidated Damages. 16.5.1 The payments called for in Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above constitute liquidated damages for causing the premature termination of this Agreement and not a penalty. A precise calculation of the full extent of damages that we will incur if this Agreement terminates because you default cannot be reasonably determined. Nevertheless, the parties agree that the lump-sum payment provided under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is reasonable in light of the damages for premature termination that may reasonably be expected to occur in such event. 16.5.2 The amounts contemplated under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is not a penalty and is intended by the parties only as a compensatory remedy for past breaches and not as a preventative remedy to deter future breaches. Neither does the sum contemplated in Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above represent a price for the privilege of not performing or its payment represent an alternative manner of performance. Accordingly, as a purely liquidated damage provision, this Section does not preclude, nor is inconsistent with, a court granting us specific performance or any other equitable remedies, such as an injunction, to prevent future breaches. Our rights to liquidated damages and specific performance or any other equitable relief are not mutually exclusive. 16.6. Enforcement Costs. You agree to pay all damages, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, that we incur (even if after the expiration or termination of this Agreement) in enforcing this Section 16 or Section 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or Transfer] below. 17. RESTRICTIONS ON COMPETITION 17.1. During Term. You acknowledge that this Agreement will give you access to valuable and confidential information regarding the System, including our business development strategy and the operational, sales, promotional and marketing methods of Franchised Businesses. You agree that during the term of this Agreement, you will not, without our prior written consent, either directly or indirectly through any other person or entity: Page 33 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n17.1.1.

For two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement or an approved Transfer to a new franchisee, you may not directly or indirectly own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, or have any other interest in any Competitive Business that is, or intends to operate, within three (3) mile radius of the Premises of your Franchised Business or within a three (3) mile radius of any Restaurant then-operating or under construction to operate under the System, except as permitted by any Franchise Agreements that remain in effect between you and us. . 17.3. Owners and Employees. The Owners agree that they will personally bind themselves to this Section 17 by signing this Agreement or the attached Guaranty. With respect to the Owners, the time period in Section 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or Transfer] will run from the expiration, termination, or Transfer of this Agreement or from the termination of the Owner's relationship with you, whichever occurs first. You must also require and obtain execution of covenants similar to those set forth in Section 12 above, and this Section 17 (as modified to apply to an individual), from any or all of the following persons: your officers, directors, and their respective spouses and employees. (These persons and the Owners are each a \"Restricted Party\") The covenants required by this Section 17.3 [Owners and Employees] shall be in the form provided in Appendix C to this Agreement. Failure by Franchisee to obtain execution of a covenant required by this Section 17.3 [Owners and Employees] shall constitute a default under Section 15.2.13 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period] above. 17.4. Indirect Violations Prohibited. You may not attempt to circumvent the restrictions in Sections 17.1 [During Term] and 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or Transfer] by engaging in prohibited activity indirectly through any other person or entity. 17.5. Enforcement. You agree that the existence of any claim you may have against us, whether or not arising from this Agreement, will not constitute a defense to our enforcement of this Section 17. You agree to pay all costs and expenses that we reasonably incur in enforcing this Section 17, including reasonable attorneys' fees. You acknowledge that a violation of the terms of this Section 17 would result in irreparable injury to us for which no adequate remedy at law may be available. Accordingly, you consent to the issuance of an injunction prohibiting any conduct in violation of the terms of this Section 17. Such injunctive relief will be in addition to any other remedies that we may have. 18. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES This Agreement does not create a fiduciary or other special relationship or make you or us an agent, legal representative, joint venturer, partner, employee, or servant of each other for any purpose. You are not authorized to, and agree that you will not, make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on our behalf, or create any obligation, express or implied, on our behalf. During the term of this Agreement, you agree to hold yourself out to the public as an independent contractor operating the Franchised Business under license from us, and you agree to disclose your status as independent contractor in all business dealings and exhibit a notice to that effect (the location and content of which we reserve the right to specify) on all promotional materials, invoices and stationery.

INDEMNIFICATION You agree to hold harmless, defend, and indemnify us and our past, present and future affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, attorneys, consultants, and employees against any claims, losses, costs, expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs of investigation, settlement costs, and interest), liabilities and damages (collectively, \"Claims\") arising directly or indirectly from, as a result of, or in connection with your activities under this Agreement. With respect to any threatened or actual litigation, proceeding, or dispute that could directly or indirectly affect us or any of the other indemnitees under this Section, if you do not assume the active defense of the matter within a reasonable time, we will have the right, but not the obligation, to: (i) choose counsel; (ii) direct and control the handling of the matter; and (iii) settle any claim against the indemnitees. This Section will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, and applies to Claims even if they exceed the limits of your insurance coverage. 20. CONSENTS AND WAIVERS 20.1. Consent. Whenever our prior written consent is required under this Agreement, you agree to make a timely written request to us for such consent. Our approval or consent must be in writing and signed by an authorized officer to be effective. 20.2. Waivers. No delay or failure to exercise any right under this Agreement or to insist upon your strict compliance with any obligation or condition, and no custom or practice that differs from the terms of this Agreement, will constitute a waiver of our right to exercise the contract provision or to demand your strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Our waiver of any particular default does not affect or impair our rights with respect to any subsequent default you may commit. Our waiver of a default by another franchisee does not affect or impair our right to demand your strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Our acceptance of any payments due from you does not waive any prior defaults. 21. NOTICES Notices related to this Agreement must be in writing and personally delivered, sent by registered mail, or by other means which affords the sender evidence of delivery, or of rejected delivery, to the respective parties. Any notice by a means that affords the sender evidence of delivery, or rejected delivery, shall be deemed to have been given at the date and time of receipt or rejected delivery. We will send notices intended for you to your address on the first page of this Agreement. You agree to send notices intended for us to our principal business address, which is currently 2200 West Cypress Creek Road, 1st Floor, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33309.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND AMENDMENTS This Agreement and the documents referred to herein constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Franchised Business and supersede all prior negotiations, representations, correspondence, and agreements concerning the same subject matter. However, nothing in this Agreement is meant to disclaim any representation that we make in the Franchise Disclosure Document that we have given to you. Any amendment to this Agreement will not be binding on either party unless that amendment is writing and signed by both parties.

Each provision of this Agreement is severable from the others. If, for any reason, any provision is determined by a court to be invalid, the invalidity will not impair the operation of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The latter will continue to be given full force and effect and bind us and you. 23.2. Survival of Clauses. Each provision of this Agreement that expressly or by reasonable implication is to be performed, in whole or in part, after the expiration, termination, or Transfer of this Agreement will survive such expiration, termination, or Transfer. 23.3 Force Majeure. If the performance of any obligation by any party under this Agreement is prevented, hindered or delayed by reason of Force Majeure, which cannot be overcome by reasonable commercial measures, then the parties shall be relieved of their respective obligations (but only to the extent, that the parties, having exercised best efforts, are prevented, hindered or delayed in such performance) during the period of such Force Majeure. The party whose performance is affected by an event of Force Majeure shall give prompt written notice in the circumstances of such Force Majeure event to the other party by describing the nature of the event and an estimate as to its duration, if possible. As used in this Agreement, the term \"Force Majeure\" means any act of God, strike, lock out or other industrial disturbance, terrorist act, war (declared or undeclared), riot, epidemic, fire or other catastrophe, or act of any government. However, your inability to obtain financing or make payments (regardless of the reason) does not constitute \"Force Majeure.\" 23.4 Cover Page, Recitals, and Captions. The parties agree to incorporate by reference, and include in the text of this Agreement, the information on the cover page and in the recital paragraphs. The parties also agree that all of the captions in this Agreement are meant only for the convenience of the parties, and none of the captions shall be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. 23.5 No Third Party Rights. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended (nor shall be deemed) to confer upon any party any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, except for you, us, and such of our respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated (and, as to you, permitted) by Sections 13 and 14 above. 24. GOVERNING LAW This Agreement and the relationship between the parties is governed by and will be construed exclusively in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida (without regard to, and without applying, Florida conflict-of-law rules). 25. DISPUTES 25.1. Submission to Mediation. Except as otherwise provided in Section 25.7 [Remedies Not Exclusive] below, any controversy or claim arising between us will first be submitted to non-binding mediation administered by an established, neutral mediation service with experience in franchise disputes. Both parties must sign a confidentiality agreement before participating in any mediation proceeding. The mediation will take place in the city where our principal offices are located at the time the demand for mediation is filed. Once either party has submitted a dispute to mediation, the obligation to attend will be binding on both parties. Each party will bear its own costs with respect to the mediation. The fee for the mediation, however, will be split equally. 25.2. Forum for Litigation. You and the Owners must file any suit against us, and we may file any suit against you, in the federal or state court where our principal office is located at the time the suit is filed. The parties waive all questions of personal jurisdiction and venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.

Any lawsuit, claim, counterclaim, or other action may be conducted only on an individual basis, and not as part of a consolidated, common, or class action. 25.4. Mutual Waiver of Jury Trial. You and we each irrevocably waive trial by jury in any litigation. 25.5. Mutual Waiver of Punitive Damages. Each of us waives any right to or claim of punitive, exemplary, multiple, or consequential damages against the other in litigation and agrees to be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained. 25.6 Time Period to Bring Claims. Any and all claims and actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the relationship between you and us, or your operation of the Restaurant, brought by any party hereto against the other, must be commenced within one (1) year from the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such claim or action, or, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed by all parties, such claim or action will be irrevocably barred. 25.7. Remedies Not Exclusive. Except as provided in Sections 25.1 [Submission to Mediation] through 25.4 [Mutual Waiver of Jury Trial] above, no right or remedy that the parties have under this Agreement is exclusive of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or under applicable law. 25.8. Our Right to Injunctive Relief. Nothing in this Agreement bars our right to obtain injunctive or declaratory relief against a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement that will cause us loss or damage. You agree that we will not be required to prove actual damages or post a bond or other security in seeking or obtaining injunctive relief (both preliminary and permanent) and/or specific performance. 25.9. Attorneys Fees and Costs. You agree to reimburse us for all expenses we reasonably incur (including attorneys' fees): (a) to enforce the terms of this Agreement or any obligation owed to us by you and/or the Owners; and (b) in the defense of any claim you and/or the Owners assert against us upon which we substantially prevail in court, arbitration, mediation, or other formal legal proceedings. 26.

The warranty shall not apply only if:\n\n     (a)     the Software and MarketSite.net Service has been not properly                 installed and used at all times and in accordance with the                 Documentation; and\n\n     (b)     Corio has requested modifications, alterations or additions to                 the Software and MarketSite.net Service that cause it to deviate                 from the Documentation.\n\n7.4     Product Warranty - Year 2000 Compliance. Commerce One warrants that the         Software and MarketSite.net Service, when used in accordance with its         associated documentation, is in all material respects capable upon         installation of accurately processing, providing and/or receiving date         data from, into and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries,         including the years 1999 and 2000, and leap year calculations; provided         that all licensee and third party equipment, systems, hardware, software         and firmware used in combination with the Software and MarketSite.net         Service properly exchange date data with the Software and MarketSite.net         Service\n\n                                     8\n\n9         OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF         MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n8       INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n8.1     By Commerce One. Commerce One shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless         Corio and its Customers from any and all damages, liabilities, costs and         expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Corio or its         Customers arising out of any claim that the Software infringes any         patent, copyright, trademark or trade right secret of a third party;         provided that Corio or its Customer promptly notifies Commerce One in         writing of any such claim and promptly tenders the control and the         defense and settlement of any such claim to Commerce One at Commerce         One's expense and with Commerce One's choice of counsel. Corio or its         Customer shall cooperate with Commerce One, at Commerce One's expense,         in defending or settling such claim and Corio or its Customer may join         in defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense. If the         Software is, or in the opinion of Commerce One may become, the subject         of any claim of infringement or if it is adjudicatively determined that         the Software infringes, then Commerce One may, at its sole option and         expense, either (i) procure for Corio the right from such third party to         use the Software, (ii) replace or modify the Software with other         suitable and substantially equivalent products so that the Software         becomes noninfringing, or if (i) and (ii) are not practicable after         Commerce One has exhausted all diligent efforts, (iii) terminate this\n\n\n\n\n\n     Agreement and refund to Corio a pro-rated portion of the fees paid         hereunder.\n\n8.2     Limitations. Commerce One shall have no liability for any infringement         based on (i) the use of the Software other than as set forth in the         Documentation; or (ii) the modification of the Software by a party other         than Commerce One, when such infringement would not have occurred but         for such modification.\n\n9       LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n     EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING UNDER SECTION 8 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO         EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR         THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY         PAID BY CORIO HEREUNDER FOR THE TRANSACTION WHICH THE LIABILITY RELATES         TO DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FILING OF THE         CAUSE OF ACTION TO WHICH THE LIABILITY RELATES. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY         ARISING UNDER SECTION 8 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER         PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR         COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY         INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY         THEORY OF LIABILITY AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF         THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 9         REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK.\n\n                                     9\n\n10         LIABILITY RELATES. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING UNDER SECTION 8 OF THIS         AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE         OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE         GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES         HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH         PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE PARTIES         AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 9 REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK.\n\n10      CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n     Each party hereby agrees that it shall not use any Confidential         Information received from the other party other than as expressly         permitted under the terms of a non-disclosure agreement to be         concurrently executed with this Agreement.\n\n11      TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n11.1    Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date         and shall continue in full force and effect for an initial period of         five (5) years. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for         subsequent one (1) year periods unless either party provides the other         party with written notification at least thirty (30) days prior to the         expiration of the initial five (5) year term or any one (1) year renewal         thereof of its intention to terminate this Agreement.\n\n11.2    Termination. If either party materially breaches any term or condition         of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within-thirty (30) days         after receiving written notice of the breach, the nonbreaching party may         terminate this Agreement on written notice at any time following the end         of such-thirty (30) day period. This Agreement shall terminate         immediately upon notice if either party becomes insolvent (i.e., becomes         unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as they come         due) or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Compliance by         the Software with the Software's specifications after expiration of the         Warranty Period shall be deemed a material condition of this Agreement.\n\n11.3    Effect of Termination. The following Sections shall survive the         termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason: 4.2, 5.3, 7,         8, 9, 10, 12 and 14. Corio's right to allow its then-existing Customers         and their Software Users to use and access the Software in accordance         with Section 2 of this Agreement and all payment obligations related         thereto shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.         Commerce One's obligation to provide Software support and maintenance to         Corio and its Customers shall survive any termination or expiration of         this Agreement, provided Corio continues to make its annual support and         maintenance payments as specified in this Agreement. Upon termination or         expiration of this Agreement, each party shall otherwise return or         destroy any Confidential Information of the other party provided,         however, Corio may retain any Confidential Information necessary for         Corio to continue supporting it's then-existing Customers.\n\n12      SOURCE CODE ESCROW.\n\n12.1    Escrow Account. Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date, Commerce         One agrees to execute an escrow agreement by and among Corio, Commerce         One and a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the \"ESCROW AGENT\"). The         Escrow Agent shall require Commerce One to place in an\n\n                                    10\n\n11         escrow account in California a copy of the source code of the Software\n\n\n\n\n\n     including all Updates and Upgrades thereto, documentation and similar         materials (the SOURCE CODE). The escrow agreement shall contain, at a         minimum, the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 12. Corio         shall bear all fees, expenses and other charges to open and maintain         such escrow account. If a Release Condition (as defined in Section 12.2         of this Agreement) occurs and the Escrow Agent provides the Source Code         to Corio under the escrow agreement, Corio agrees to hold the Source         Code in confidence pursuant to the provisions contained in Section 10 of         this Agreement, and not to use them for any purpose other than those         purposes contemplated under Section 12.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.2    Release. Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing if it believes that         one of the following events (the \"RELEASE CONDITIONS\") has occurred and         that it intends to seek release of the Source Code from the escrow         account: (i) Commerce One's dissolution or ceasing to do business in the         normal course, or (ii) Commerce One's repeated and material breach of         its support and maintenance obligations under Section 5 of this         Agreement and such breach is not cured within sixty (60) days of receipt         of written notice thereof from Corio. If Commerce One notifies Corio in         writing that it disputes whether any such event has occurred, officers         of each of the parties shall negotiate for a period of ten (10) business         days to attempt to resolve the dispute. At the end of such ten (10)         business day period, if the parties have not resolved the dispute, the         matter shall be referred to arbitration in the manner provided in         Section 14.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.3    License. Upon the release of the Source Code to Corio pursuant to         Section 12.2 of this Agreement, Corio shall have a royalty-free,         nonexclusive, nontransferable, right and license in the Territory to use         and modify the Source Code to support and maintain the Software until         the expiration or termination of Corio's Customers' End User License         Agreements. The object code derived from the Source Code so modified         shall be subject to the same rights and restrictions on use,         reproduction and disclosure that are contained in this Agreement with         respect to the Software. Corio shall not distribute, sell or sublicense         the Source Code. Subject to the licenses expressly granted in this         Agreement, Commerce One shall retain all right, title and interest in         and to the Source Code. This license shall be deemed to extend worldwide         in scope if Corio, at the time one or more Release Conditions has         occurred, has been granted worldwide license rights by Commerce One         under Section 2 of this Agreement.\n\n13      SHARED RESOURCES.\n\n13.1    Operations. To the extent not provided for within the Statement of Work         covered by the Implementation Fee, Commerce One shall provide Corio with         access to Commerce One operations personnel as reasonably requested by         Corio, subject to payment by Corio of Commerce One's standard fees [*].         These Commerce One operations personnel shall work together with Corio         personnel to optimize the architecture and performance of the Software         and MarketSite.net Service in a hosted environment. Commerce One shall         only commit personnel with expertise in installations, operating         environments and networking functionality.\n\n13.2    Consulting. To the extent not provided for within the Statement of Work         covered by the Implementation Fee, Commerce One shall provide Corio with         access to Commerce One consulting personnel as reasonably requested by         Corio, subject to payment by Corio of Commerce One's standard fees [*].

Commerce One may, in its sole but         reasonable discretion, elect to assign resources from a third party         systems integrator subject to advance notification to Corio of such         election.\n\n13.3    Engineering. Commerce One shall provide Corio with reasonable access to         Commerce One engineering personnel at no additional cost to Corio. Joint         engineering work may include product development, including without         limitation, technical and functional application development and         integration.\n\n13.4    Other. All services provided hereunder, in addition to services         subsequently requested by Corio (e.g. customization of the Software)         shall be subject to the terms of a separate agreement between the         parties.\n\n13.5    Ownership. Subject to Commerce One's pre-existing ownership of any         materials or technology provided to Corio, the results of all such         development efforts set forth in this Section 13, including all         intellectual property rights in any software interface coding or         programs created solely by Corio during the term of this Agreement to         enable the Software to operated within the Corio Servers' hosted         environment (\"DEVELOPMENTS\"), shall be owned by Corio, unless such         Developments are supported on an ongoing basis by Commerce One in which         case Commerce One will retain all ownership rights, including\n\n\n\n\n\n     intellectual property rights in the Developments. To the extent that         Commerce One would otherwise have a claim of ownership in such         Developments, Commerce One hereby assigns all rights in and to such         Developments to Corio. Further, Commerce One represents and warrants         that all Commerce One employees, agents, contractors or consultants that         will be provided to work together with Corio have or will have signed         agreements with customary terms containing confidentiality provisions         and assignment of inventions (\"EMPLOYEE NDA/INVENTION AGREEMENT\"). Corio         covenants and warrants that it will not disclose to Commerce One or its         officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors or consultants any         proprietary information, including without limitation any technical         information related to Developments created solely by Corio under this         Agreement, except upon the written authorization to do so by a Corporate         Officer of Commerce One. Commerce One covenants that during the term of         this Agreement, it will continue to require all Commerce One employees,         agents, contractors or consultants to sign an Employee NDA/Invention         Agreement and that Commerce One will furnish to Corio copies of such         signed agreements upon Corio's request. Ownership of intellectual         property rights to any enhancements, modifications or derivative works         to the Software itself which may be developed jointly by the parties or         solely by Corio shall be negotiated by the parties prior to the start of         any such development work.\n\n13.6    Independent Development: Covenant not to Sue. Nothing in this Agreement         will be construed to prohibit either parties' right to independently         develop the Developments contemplated above. Each party covenants that         it shall not, under any circumstances, sue the other party (or its         officers, directors, successors and assigns) or any of that parties'         licensees, customers, or distributors (\"Protected Entities\") for patent         infringment under any future patents or future patent rights relating to         said Developments, that either party owns or controls, so long as that         Protected Entity has a license from Commerce One or Corio to the         Software, or to a product that is a modification of, derivative work         based on, or replacement for the Software. The foregoing covenant is         binding on Corio's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the         benefit of any\n\n                                    12\n\n13         of Commerce One's successors and assigns, and is binding on Commerce         One's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the benefit of any         of Corio's successors and assigns.\n\n14      MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n14.1    Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement or any rights or         obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without         the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the         foregoing, either party shall have the right to assign this Agreement in         connection with the merger or acquisition of such party or the sale of         all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement without         such consent, except in the case where such transaction involves a         direct competitor of the other party where consent of the other party         will be required. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and         inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and         permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of this Section 14.1         shall be null and void.\n\n14.2    Waiver and Amendment. No modification, amendment or waiver of any         provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and         signed by the party to be charged. No failure or delay by either party         in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement, except         as specifically provided herein, shall operate as a waiver of any such         right, power or remedy.\n\n14.3    Choice of Law; Arbitration; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by         the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws         provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts         for the International Sale of Goods.

The arbitration shall be conducted by         one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules in San         Francisco County, California. A judgment upon the award may be entered         in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without         limitation the courts in San Francisco, California. The non-prevailing         party in the arbitration shall pay all fees and charges of the American         Arbitration Association; each party, however, shall be responsible for         the payment of all fees and expenses connected with the presentation of         its respective case.\n\n14.4    Notices. All notices, demands or consents required or permitted under         this Agreement shall be in writing. Notice shall be considered delivered         and effective on the earlier of actual receipt or when (a) personally         delivered; (b) the day following transmission if sent by telex, telegram         or facsimile followed by written confirmation by registered overnight         carrier or certified United States mail; or (c) one (1) day after         posting when sent by registered private overnight carrier (e.g., DHL,         Federal Express, etc.); or (d) five (5) days after posting when sent by         certified United States mail. Notice shall be sent to the parties at the         addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement or at such other         address as shall be specified by either party to the other in writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5    Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors with         respect to each other. Each party is not and shall not be deemed to be         an employee, agent, partner or legal representative of the other for any         purpose and shall not have any right, power or authority to create any         obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other.\n\n14.6    Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of         competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be         changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the\n\n                                    13\n\n14         objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by         law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full         force and effect.\n\n14.7    Force Majeure. Neither party shall be deemed to be in breach of this         agreement for any failure or delay in performance caused by reasons         beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God,         earthquakes, strikes or shortages of materials.\n\n14.8    Subcontract. Commerce One understands and agrees that Corio shall solely         direct the provision of Corio Services and may subcontract certain         portions of the Corio Services to third parties at any time during the         term of the Agreement.\n\n14.9    Bankruptcy. The parties hereto agree that Corio, as a licensee of         Commerce One's intellectual property, shall be afforded all of the         protections afforded to a licensee under Section 365(n) of the United         States Bankruptcy Code, as amended from time to time (the \"CODE\") so         that the Trustee or Debtor in Possession, as defined in the Code, will         not interfere with Corio's license with respect to the Software as         provided in this Agreement, as set forth in Section 365(n) of the Code.\n\n14.10   Complete Understanding. This Agreement including all Exhibits, and the         Non Disclosure Agreement and the Statement of Work referenced in this         Agreement and incorporated by reference herein, constitutes the final,         complete and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the         subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous         agreement.

(\"CNET\") and Cyberian Outpost, Inc. (the \"Company\"). Pursuant to this Agreement, CNET will provide various links and other online and television promotions (collectively, the \"Promotions\") to the Company to assist the Company in promoting its products and services and facilitating the sale of products to potential buyers through its Internet site. CNET will be compensated by the Company for providing the Promotions. Accordingly, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n\n1.   Background.\n\n     1.1  The Company. The Company operates an electronic retailing operation           through its Internet sites located at www.cyberianoutpost.com or           www.outpost.com (together with any successors to such sites, the           \"Company Site\"). Through the Company Site, the Company sells or           facilitates the sale of various products and services, either directly           or as an agent for third party vendors. All products and services           offered for sale through the Company Site are referred to as the           \"Products.\"\n\n     1.2  CNET. CNET produces television programs and operates a network of           Internet sites on the world wide web. For purposes of this Agreement,           the \"CNET Sites\" refer to any Internet sites operated by CNET or its           subsidiaries, including without limitation the sites referenced in           Section 2.5 and Exhibit A.\n\n2.   CNET's Obligations.\n\n     2.1  TV Promotions. CNET will provide the Company one 15 second \"spot\" for           Promotions on its syndicated weekly TV program, TV.COM. Promotions           will run on each weekly episode of TV.COM during the Term; provided           that TV.COM remains on the air throughout such period. Should TV.COM           not be run on the air during a portion of the Term, CNET will run two           download.com banner advertising programs per month during such portion           of the Term in lieu of the foregoing TV.COM Promotions.\n\n     2.2  Banner Promotions. CNET will provide advertising banners to the           Company during the Term as described in Exhibit A.\n\n     2.3  Retail Promotions.\n\n            2.3.1  CNET will provide for various retail Promotions across the CNET                  Sites, which may include text/HTML links, buttons, portals and                  other fixed Promotions that include embedded links to the                  Company Site (the \"Retail Promotions\" and, together with the                  advertising banners contemplated in the preceding paragraph,                  the \"Online Promotions\").\n\n          2.3.2  Subject to Section 4 below, CNET will provide the Company with                  a total of at least (a) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during                  the first three months of the Term, (b) [XXXXXX] Retail                  Impressions during the second three months of the Term, (c)                  [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during the third three months                  of the Term, and (d) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during                  the fourth three months of the Term. For such purposes, a                  \"Retail Impression\" means the display of one page of a CNET                  Site that contains at least one Retail Promotion. If CNET fails                  to provide the Retail Impressions required by the preceding                  sentence during the Term, then CNET will continue to display                  Retail Impressions in accordance with this Agreement following                  the Term (notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the                  Term) until the required number of Retail Impressions has been                  delivered.\n\n     2.4  Placement of Retail Promotions. CNET will determine the location and           type of each Retail Promotion displayed throughout the CNET Sites and           may phase in certain types of Retail Promotions as they are developed.           CNET currently intends to display Retail Promotions consisting of           text/HTML links, pre-filled with an appropriate query string or link           (\"Pre-Filled Links\"), as set forth in this Section. The Retail           Promotions contemplated by this Section will be displayed above the           fold where the graphical layout of the page reasonably permits such           positioning (as determined by CNET), and in other cases the Retail           Promotions will be prominently positioned below the fold. For the           purposes of clarity, the \"fold\" is defined as the visible portion of           the screen on a standard 640 x 480 screen size.\n\n          2.4.1  On SEARCH.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on the\n\n\n\n\n\n                 search query page related to Shopping and on every search                  results page served by CNET.\n\n          2.4.2  On CNET.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on pages                  within the site except the Front Door and except for pages                  within the Personalities and Community sections.\n\n          2.4.3  On BUILDER.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on                  pages within the site except the Front Door and the \"Builder                  Buzz\" section.\n\n            2.4.4  On GAMECENTER.COM, NEWS.COM, DOWNLOAD.COM and SHAREWARE.COM,                  CNET will display a Pre-Filled Link on pages within the site                  except the Front Door.\n\n          2.4.5  Other pages of the CNET Sites, CNET will display additional                  Retail Promotions as appropriate and as mutually agreed upon.\n\n     2.5  Design and Production of Online Promotions. The Company will design           any graphics required for the Online Promotions and provide pre-filled           query strings or links for all of the Pre-Filled Links, with           reasonable assistance from CNET, and the Company will supply digital           copies of such graphics and other materials to CNET. CNET will be           responsible for incorporating the Online Promotions into the CNET           Sites and for ensuring that the Online Promotions are accessible to           users of the CNET Sites (\"Users\").\n\n     2.6  Reporting. Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term,           CNET will provide a report to the Company indicating the number of           Retail Promotions displayed on the CNET Sites during such month and           the number of times that a User clicked on a Retail Promotion during           such month. CNET will also provide standard reporting for banner           advertisements and television Promotions.\n\n3.   The Company's Obligations:\n\n     3.1  Operation of Company Site. The Company will be responsible for           ensuring that each link embedded within an Online Promotion takes the           User to the appropriate area within the Company Site, and that the           Company Site functions with reasonable reliability and in a           commercially reasonable manner throughout the Term. In particular, the           Company agrees that the Company Site will comply with the performance           standards set forth in Exhibit B throughout the Term. Any failure by           the Company to comply with this paragraph will be deemed to be a           material breach of this Agreement.\n\n     3.2  Reporting. Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term,           the Company will provide a report to CNET indicating the aggregate           number of referrals from the CNET Sites to the Company Site during           such month, the resulting number of buyers, the aggregate behavior           (including orders and sales volume) of those buyers, and the total           revenue attributable to the Online Promotions minus applicable sales           tax, shipping costs, returns and cancellations (the \"CNET Sales\"). The           \"CNET Sales\" will be counted as sales by the Company to each User who           accesses the Company Site through a link from an Online Promotion for           a period of 4 hours from the referral, CNET and The Company will agree           on technical procedures to allow the easy and accurate reporting of           CNET Sales. The Company will make this information available in a           manner which\n\n            allows CNET and the Company to understand the performance of the           various Online Promotions.\n\n     3.3  Cash Consideration.\n\n          3.3.1  For each month during the Term, the Company will pay CNET a                  minimum of [XXXX] in cash, plus [XXX] of CNET Sales. Payments                  under this paragraph will be based on the reports prepared by                  the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may challenge such                  reports as contemplated by Section 9.5) and will be due within                  30 days after the end of each month of the Term.\n\n          3.3.2  Payments under this Section 3.3 will be made by wire transfer                  of immediately available funds and are nonrefundable once paid.\n\n     3.4  User Information. At least once each calendar quarter, the Company           will deliver to CNET all aggregate data collected as a result of the           CNET Sales, including but not limited to, demographic data, buying           behavior as measured by conversion to sale, frequency of purchasing,           average order size, and a comparison to the respective average for the           Company.\n\n     3.5  Reciprocal Marketing. For the duration of the Term, the Company will           place a link within the Beta Report Newsletter, the Cyberian Express           Newsletter, the Gamer's Express newsletter, or any newsletter to which           users can subscribe to which is provided by the Company to its users           (expressly excluded from this obligation are emails that are sent by           the Company for product announcements, or personalized emails sent to           users upon product purchase. This link will be a text phrase or series           of text phrases encouraging the users to sign up for CNET's free email           newsletters for technology News, CNET Dispatch, and Software &           Hardware Services. CNET will provide all entry forms and operate the           production and sending of the newsletter. CNET agrees not to           specifically target these subscribers separately from the general\n\n\n\n\n\n          database of subscribers to CNET's various newsletters. Should the           Company provide a persistent link or series of links (as distinguished           from occasional and ad hoc links to product reviews either on the           Company Site or in any communication by the Company to its customers)           to a \"Technology Content Provider\", CNET shall be given at least equal           prominence to any other Technology Content Provider provided that CNET           offers comparable editorial content. A Technology Content Provider is           defined as a company providing news product information or reviews           about technology products that is not a manufacturer of those           products.\n\n4.   Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") will begin on      February 1, 1998 and end on the first anniversary of the date of this      Agreement; provided that (a) either party may terminate this Agreement,      effective at any time after the first three\n\n       months of the Term, by giving 30 days' written notice of termination to the      other party, and (b) either party may terminate this Agreement at any time      by giving written notice of termination to the other party, if the other      party commits a material breach of its obligations hereunder that is not      cured within 30 days after notice thereof from the non-breaching party. If      this Agreement is terminated during any of the three month periods      referenced in Section 2.3.2, then the required number of Retail Impressions      applicable thereunder to such three month period will be pro rated      accordingly.\n\n5.   Exclusivity. For purposes of this agreement \"Competing Computer Products      Retailer\" means any company other than the Company that is engaged in the      retail sale of computer products, with the exception of CNET Direct, which      operates BuyDirect.com. During the Term, CNET will not enter into more than      two other agreements under which CNET receives consideration from a      Competing Computer Products Retailer for displaying permanent links to or      other fixed promotions for such Competing Computer Products Retailer on any      CNET Site; provided that the foregoing will not restrict the display of(a)      standard advertisements for any Competing Computer Products Retailer or its      products or (b) any promotions within COMPUTERS.COM or within CNET's Snap!      Online service (which are expressly excluded from this provision). The      parties acknowledge that the foregoing will not prevent CNET from      displaying text links and other references to Competing Computer Products      Retailers as reasonably necessary to provide appropriate editorial and      search related services on the CNET Sites. The Retail Promotions granted to      the Company shall be placed in such a way as to provide no more or less      prominence to the Company than is provided to any other Competing Computer      Retailer signing an agreement with CNET.\n\n6.  Trademark Licenses.\n\n     6.1  The Company hereby grants to CNET a non-exclusive, royalty-free           license, effective throughout the Term, to use, display and publish           any of the Company trademarks, tradenames, service marks and logos           that may be delivered by the Company to CNET expressly for inclusion           in the Promotions, solely for use in connection with the Promotions.           Any use of the Company Marks by CNET must comply with any reasonable           usage guidelines communicated by the Company to CNET from time to           time. Nothing contained in this Agreement will give CNET any right,           title or interest in or to the Company Marks or the goodwill           associated therewith, except for the limited usage rights expressly           provided above. CNET acknowledges and agrees that, as between the           Company and CNET, the Company is the sole owner of all rights in and           to the Company Marks.\n\n     6.2  The Company hereby represents and warrants to CNET that the Company           has, and will have throughout the Term, all necessary rights in and to           the Company Marks to grant CNET the licenses and usage rights           contemplated by this Agreement without violating the rights of any           third party.\n\n  7.

General Supplier and/or Reseller may assign or novate this Agreement and the rights and obligations under it to any of its affiliates or upon any merger or acquisition or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets relating to the Agreement. Any purported assignment of rights in violation of this subsection is void. The relationship between the Parties is that of supplier and purchaser. Reseller is an independent contractor and is not the legal representative, agent, joint venture, partner, or employee of Supplier. Reseller may describe itself as Supplier's 'authorized distributor', but may not hold itself out as the Supplier's agent. Reseller has no authority to assume or create any obligations of any kind or to make any representations or warranties, whether express or implied, on behalf of the Supplier, nor to bind the Supplier in any respect.\n\n9.\n\n10. 10.1.\n\n10.2.\n\n11.\n\n12. 12.1.\n\n12.2.\n\n12.3.\n\n12.4.\n\n13. 14. 14.1.\n\n14.2.\n\nSource: HEALTHCARE INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGIES INC., 8-K, 8/12/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExcept as to the timely payment by Reseller for the Products purchased under this Agreement, no failure or omission to carry out or observe any provision of this Agreement shall give rise to any claim by one Party against the other, or be a breach of this Agreement, if the same is caused by or arises out of circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the other Party, including technical difficulties beyond such Party's reasonable control that delay or prevent manufacture (\"Force Majeure\"). However, the Parties shall endeavor to avoid, remove, or cure all such conditions as soon as is reasonably feasible. If either Party is prevented or hindered from carrying out its obligations under this Agreement due to a Force Majeure, this Agreement shall be suspended as long as the Force Majeure persists. If such period exceeds 1 month, either Party may terminate this Agreement on giving written notice to the other. No failure or delay on the part of either Party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement shall be construed or operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude the further exercise of such right or remedy. If any provision or part of any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if the Agreement had been executed without that provision or part. All notices or other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given in person, by courier or by registered mail (provided that written confirmation of receipt is provided) addressed as set forth in the heading of this Agreement or such other address as any Party may designate to the other in accordance with this procedure. All communications delivered in person or by courier service shall be deemed to have been received upon delivery, shall be deemed to have been received on the business day following transmission with confirmed answer back, and all notices and other communications sent by registered mail shall be deemed to have been received within 3 business days after posting. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and all disputes and controversies arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall be brought exclusively before the competent courts in New York County, New York; provided however that judgment shall be enforceable in any country and that nothing in this Section shall prevent or restrict either Party from seeking interim relief in any competent jurisdiction as it may deem fit. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Supplier and the Reseller. All previous or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, understandings, and communications between the Supplier and the Reseller are replaced in their entirety by this Agreement. In entering into this Agreement, neither Party has relied on any warranties, representations, or other matters other than as set out in this Agreement. All conditions, warranties, or other terms implied by statute or common law are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument executed by authorized representatives of the Parties. Each of Reseller and Supplier will, respectively, ensure that it and its employees, agents or affiliates, or by any independent contractors on its behalf or for its benefit, shall comply with the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78dd-1 et seq.) and any analogous anti-bribery and anti-corruption law, rule, regulation that may apply to any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including but not limited to in connection with the sale, resale, import, export, transportation, or shipment of the Products. Neither party to this Agreement will make any payment, directly or indirectly, of money or other assets, including but not limited to compensation derived from this Agreement or any Order placed under it, to government or political party officials, officials of international organizations, candidates for public office, or representatives of other businesses or persons acting on behalf of any of the foregoing, that would constitute a violation of any law, rule, or regulation.

This Agreement is effective as of August 1, 2004, (the \"Effective Date\") and shall terminate on July 31, 2009, (the \"Termination Date\") unless earlier terminated or extended as provided for herein.\n\nThe following points outline this agreement:\n\n1.       PURPOSE\n\nUnder and subject to the terms of this Agreement:\n\na.       AEIS will provide Schoolpop for resale the following stored                   value cards: Encompass(R) Select, Persona(R) Select, Fill It                   Up(R), and Be My Guest(R), and any other stored value products                   developed by AEIS and mutually agreed upon by both parties,                   (\"Cards\"). The Cards shall be sold only to those of                   Schoolpop's clients and prospective clients (the \"Clients\"),                   in the United States who are nonprofit organizations, (\"NPO                   Marketplace\"), which are defined as organizations that are (i)                   a school, (ii) an organization formed as not-for-profit under                   its charter documents, or (iii) an organization related to (i)                   or (ii) such as a participating school's Parent Teacher                   Organization or other similarly related organization.\n\nb.       Period One shall mean the Effective Date through the date that                   Schoolpop has met all of the Security Requirements as such                   term is defined herein and has received approval from AEIS to                   assume all Card inventory, distribution and fulfillment                   responsibilities as currently managed by AEIS. Period Two                   shall commence with the end of Period One through the                   Termination Date.\n\n2.       EXCLUSIVITY\n\na.       Schoolpop shall have the exclusive right to resell Cards in                   the NPO Marketplace. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Schoolpop                   shall fund from AEIS a minimum of $52,000,000 of Cards (the                   \"Guaranteed Minimum\") in each Contract Year in order to                   maintain the exclusive right to sell Cards in the NPO                   Marketplace. A Contract Year shall be the period of August 1                   through July 31 of the succeeding year. In any Contract Year                   in which Schoolpop fails to fund the Guaranteed Minimum, AEIS                   shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) terminate                   the Agreement or (b) revoke the exclusivity.\n\nb.       In consideration of the exclusivity referred to above,                   Schoolpop shall pay AEIS a marketing rights fee (\"Marketing                   Rights Fee\"), of $1,250,000. The Marketing Rights Fee shall be                   paid in five (5) equal installments of $250,000 on March 15th                   of each year with the first such payment being due on March                   15, 2005 and with the final payment due on March 15, 2009.\n\nc.       Schoolpop shall also pay AEIS a fee of $250,000, (the                   \"Encompass(R) Select Fee\") as consideration for the right to                   sell the Encompass(R) Select Card through December 31, 2004.                   The Encompass(R) Select Fee shall be payable concurrently with                   the execution of this Agreement.\n\nd.       Schoolpop understands and agrees that this Agreement does not                   grant Schoolpop any exclusive right to market the Cards or any                   other AEIS products and services outside of the NPO                   Marketplace. AEIS, on its own behalf, reserves the right to                   market its Cards and other products and services directly as\n\n1\n\nwell as through additional firms on terms and conditions that                   it selects in its sole discretion, provided that no such sales                   shall take place within the NPO Marketplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.       INVENTORY AND FORECASTING\n\na.       Schoolpop shall secure a physical location for maintaining,                   distributing, and fulfilling Card inventory no later than                   August 1, 2004 which location shall be subject to such                   security requirements (the \"Security Requirements\") as shall                   be required by AEIS or American Express Travel Related                   Services, Inc. all as further set forth in the Trust Agreement                   attached hereto as Exhibit 1.\n\nb.       Schoolpop shall effectively manage its Card inventory and                   Ordering schedule such that all Cards are resold and                   distributed to the Client with the following Card expiration                   lives (the \"Card Life\") intact:\n\ni.       Persona(R) Select - nine (9) months                   ii.      Encompass(R) Select, Be My Guest(R), Fill It Up(R) -                            three (3) months          The Card life of any Cards other than Cards specifically indicated in          b(i). and b(ii) above (\"New Cards\"), shall be mutually agreed upon in          writing.\n\nc.       During Period One, Card expiration shall be determined by the                   date Schoolpop places an Order (the \"Order\") and provides full                   payment and clearance of funding. During Period Two, Card Life                   shall be determined by the date Schoolpop places an Order.\n\nd.       Should any Card expire or lose Card Life prior to                   distribution, Schoolpop shall assume all loss associated with                   the Card funding, if applicable, and shall pay AEIS a $2.00                   per Card destruction fee. Schoolpop shall not return such                   Cards to AEIS, and shall follow the destruction process as                   detailed in the Trust Agreement.\n\ne.       Card Life shall be unaffected by the termination of this                   Agreement.\n\nf.       From the Effective Date through September 30, 2004, Schoolpop                   may order non-standard Encompass(R) Select denominations                   (other than 25, 50, 75, and 100 Points) up to a maximum of 200                   Points. Such non-standard Encompass(R) Select denominations                   require eight (8) weeks to fulfill and must be ordered in                   boxes of 100 Cards of like denominations. Schoolpop shall                   discontinue reselling Encompass(R) Select Cards on December                   31, 2004 and shall effectively manage and forecast                   Encompass(R) Select Card needs to deplete such inventory as of                   December 31, 2004. In the event that any unsold Encompass(R)                   Select Cards remain in inventory by Schoolpop on December 31,                   2004, Schoolpop shall provide to AEIS, no later than January                   5, 2005, the Encompass(R) Select Card numbers, the respective                   expiration dates and denominations of the Cards. AEIS shall                   invoice Schoolpop for the applicable Card destruction fees                   which shall be payable by Schoolpop within thirty days (30) of                   receipt of invoice. Such Card list shall be submitted on a                   disk/CD and shall be sent via a form of shipment where                   signature is required upon delivery.\n\ng.       Effective with Period Two, Schoolpop shall provide to AEIS a                   twelve (12) month sold Card forecast and Card inventory                   forecast (hereinafter defined). In addition, Schoolpop shall                   provide AEIS with a monthly forecast, no later than the third                   business day of each month, of the number of Cards to be sold                   to its clients, (\"Sold Card Forecast\") as well as the number                   of Cards to be stocked in inventory, (\"Card Inventory                   Forecast\"), (collectively referred to as the \"Forecasts\") for                   the month, ninety-days out. For example, Schoolpop shall                   provide AEIS with the Card Inventory Forecast and Sold Card                   Forecast in August for the month of November. The Forecasts                   will be relied on, (\"Locked\") at the time they are reported.\n\nh.       Changes to the Forecasts within the Locked period are                   expected. However, any changes to Locked Forecasts will not                   impact any applicable penalties as detailed below in                   subsections (i) and (j). AEIS will place reliance on the                   Forecasts provided by Schoolpop to align resources and ensure                   adequate production, fulfillment and customer service                   capabilities. Schoolpop shall provide AEIS with any changes to                   the Locked Forecasts on a monthly basis including any                   respective changes to either Forecast for the remaining twelve                   (12) month period.\n\ni.       In any consecutive three (3) month period in which the                   difference between the Card Inventory Forecast less the actual                   Card Order volume for that period is a shortage of ten percent                   or greater (10%+), AEIS reserves the right to assess a                   penalty, (\"Card Inventory Penalty\") of sixteen and one-half                   cents ($0.165) per Card for such difference as detailed in                   Examples 1 and 2 below.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            EXAMPLE 1            --------------- --------------------- ------------------ ------------------ -----------------                            FORECAST PERIOD       ACTUAL VOLUME      FORECASTED VOLUME  DIFFERENCE            --------------- --------------------- ------------------ ------------------ -----------------\n\n\n\n\n\n                MONTH 1         10/1/04-10/31/04      8,000              10,000             (2,000) 20%            --------------- --------------------- ------------------ ------------------ -----------------            MONTH 2         11/1/04-11/30/04      8,500              10,000             (1,500) 15%            --------------- --------------------- ------------------ ------------------ -----------------            MONTH 3         12/01/04-12/31/04     8750               10,000             (1,250) 12.5%            ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------            PENALTY                                                 4,750 X $0.165 = $783.75            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            EXAMPLE 2            --------------- --------------------- ----------------- ------------------- -----------------                                                                                     MONTH 1         12/1/04-12/31/04      10,500            11,000              (500) 4.5%            --------------- --------------------- ----------------- ------------------- -----------------            MONTH 2         1/1/05-1/31/05        10,000            13,000              (3,000) 23%            --------------- --------------------- ----------------- ------------------- -----------------            MONTH 3         02/01/05-02/28/05     12,000            12,500              (500) 4%            ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------            PENALTY                                                 NO PENALTY            ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------\n\nj.       In any given month where the difference between the Sold Card                   Forecast less the actual Card activation volume, (\"Cards in                   Force\") is a shortage of ten percent or greater (10%+), AEIS                   reserves the right to assess a penalty, the (\"Customer Service                   Penalty\") which shall be calculated by converting Cards in                   Force into call volume minutes as follows:\n\ni.       Cards in Force times the call to card ratio times the                            average handle time equals the total call volume                            minutes. AEIS will calculate the respective product's                            average year-to-date call to Card ratio and the                            average year-to-date handle time monthly to calculate                            the call volume minutes. For purposes of example, the                            year-to-date through August 2004, Encompass(R) Select                            average call to Card ratio is 2.43 and the average                            handle time is 4.0 minutes.\n\n&sbsp;      ii.

AEIS may, at its sole discretion, decline to provide Cards to                   Clients.\n\ne.

AEIS's designated vendor will ship the Cards as follows:\n\ni.       During Period One, AEIS' designated vendor will use                            reasonable commercial efforts to ship the Cards as                            detailed below, following receipt and clearance by                            AEIS of Card Funding.\n\nii.

Schoolpop shall                   distribute to each Cardholder the Cardholder agreement as                   provided with each Card and which includes instructions on                   \"How to Use the Card\". Should Schoolpop or its Client                   distribute Cards without such Cardholder agreement, Schoolpop                   shall indemnify and hold harmless AEIS, its parents,                   subsidiaries and their respective affiliates, officers,                   directors, employees and agents, against any and all Loss,                   hereinafter defined, that AEIS may incur or be subjected to as                   a result of such action, including, without limitation, any                   claims brought by any entity including but not limited to                   governmental entities and Cardholders.\n\nj.       Purchases made with a Card having insufficient Points will be                   deemed a deniable transaction. The correct way to handle the                   purchase is described in the Cardholder agreement. If there is                   a purchase made on a Card where there are insufficient Points                   on the Card, the negative amount will be the responsibility of                   the person whose signature appears on the Card, as described                   in the Cardholder agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nk.       CARDS LOST OR STOLEN IN TRANSIT IN THE INITIAL SHIPMENT FROM                   AEIS WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF AEIS. The full risk of loss                   for ordered Cards shall pass to Schoolpop immediately upon                   their delivery to Schoolpop by AEIS and AEIS shall not                   reimburse Schoolpop or Client for any delivered Card that is                   lost, stolen, misappropriated, or that otherwise disappears or                   is fraudulently or inappropriately used (together referred to                   as \"Loss\"). Schoolpop shall remain solely liable for any Loss                   caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of its                   employees, agents or representatives after the shipment has                   been received by Schoolpop. AEIS will not reimburse Schoolpop                   or its Client or be responsible for any Loss in connection                   with or after delivery of Cards to Schoolpop, its Clients or                   the Cardholder whether they are shipped to Schoolpop, its                   Client, or to either of their pre-designated delivery agents.                   Only Cardholders are eligible to receive replacements from                   AEIS and replacements are given only in accordance with the                   agreement between the Cardholder and AEIS. Cards are usually                   shipped in packaging with AEIS' designated vendor as the                   return address. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AEIS shall bear                   no risk of Loss and of non-receipt of Cards by the intended                   Cardholder in the event that AEIS is instructed to use another                   address as the return address, the address provided to AEIS                   for Schoolpop or the Client was incorrect, the request for the                   Card was unauthorized, and/or any information received by AEIS                   with regard to the processing of the Order was fraudulent or                   incorrect.\n\nl.

Accordingly, both parties agree                   to receive and hold in confidence all Confidential Information                   considered proprietary or confidential by the other party, and                 &sbsp; agree not to disclose or use such information in any manner                   except for uses contemplated by this Agreement unless                   permitted in writing in advance by the other party (except for                   information disclosed to Cardholders in accordance with the                   Cardholder Agreement). Both parties also agree to bind their                   employees, and subcontractors to compliance with this                   paragraph and to take all other reasonable action to ensure                   protection of the Confidential Information.\n\nc.       Such Confidential Information is subject to the terms and                   conditions of this Agreement, if (a) such Confidential                   Information is either Party's marketing philosophies and                   objectives, financial and pricing information, Client lists,                   business processes or competitive advantages and                   disadvantages; (b) such Confidential Information is disclosed                   verbally and is verbally identified as proprietary or                   confidential at the time of disclosure, and there exists a                   written record that such Confidential Information was                   disclosed and identified verbally as proprietary or                   confidential; or (c) such Confidential Information is in                   written, graphic or electronic form when disclosed and the                   media that contains such Confidential Information is clearly                   marked \"confidential\" or \"proprietary\", or something                   substantially similar. Notwithstanding the foregoing,                   Confidential Information shall not include (d) information                   that is publicly known, already known by, or in the possession                   of the non-disclosing party, or (e) is independently developed                   by the non-disclosing party without use or reference to the                   other party's Confidential Information, or (f) is rightly\n\n9\n\nobtained by the non-disclosing party from a source other than                   the disclosing party without such restrictions.\n\nd.       Each party agrees that during the term of this Agreement and                   thereafter (a) it will use Confidential Information belonging                   to the other party solely for purposes outlined in this                   Agreement, (subject to the terms and conditions thereof), (b)                   it will not disclose Confidential Information belonging to the                   other Party to any third party other than the receiving                   Party's employees, affiliates, agents, permitted vendors,                   subcontractors and/or professional advisors on a need-to-know                   basis who are advised of the confidential nature of the                   Confidential Information and under a similar confidentiality                   agreement, and (c) each Party will treat the Confidential                   Information of the other Party with the same care that the                   receiving party normally affords its own proprietary and                   confidential information. If any such employee, affiliate,                   agent, subcontractor or professional advisor discloses or uses                   the Confidential Information in a manner not permitted under                   this Agreement, the party disclosing the Confidential                   Information to such employee, affiliate, agent, subcontractor                   or professional advisor will be liable therefore. If either                   party is required by law to disclose Confidential Information,                   it may be disclosed, provided that, unless prohibited,                   sufficient prior notice is given to the non-disclosing party                   to afford it an opportunity to take whatever steps it deems                   necessary to protect the confidential nature of the                   Confidential Information. In the event a party is required to                   disclose the other party's Confidential Information in                   connection with any judicial proceeding or government                   investigation, a notification of such requirement shall                   promptly occur allowing a reasonable time for the appropriate                   party to seek a protective Order from the appropriate court or                   government agency. Thereafter, Confidential Information may be                   disclosed to the extent required by law, subject to any                   applicable protective Order.\n\ne.       Upon request of the other party, each party will promptly\n\n\n\n\n\nreturn to the other any or all Confidential Information of the                   other then in its possession or under its control provided,                   however, that each party may retain one copy of all such                   Confidential Information solely for its own internal records,                   such Confidential Information to remain subject to the                   restrictions on use and disclosure contained in this Agreement\n\nf.

Schoolpop shall, and shall cause its Client to, (d) cooperate                   with AEIS with respect to complying and avoiding any claims                   based on PI rights of others including without limitation                   Schoolpop and/or its Client communicating to AEIS all                   necessary acts and safeguards required of AEIS in handling PI,                   (e) providing such notices and information to Authorized Users                   as required, (f) identifying all PI as PI at the time of its                   transmission to AEIS, (g) segregating any PI required to be                   handled differently as necessary to ensure its proper                   treatment including without limitation not providing PI to                   AEIS and, if applicable, (h) PI that has been \"opted out\" of                   Schoolpop's or its Client's permission for use hereunder.                   Schoolpop and its Client shall respectively bear the cost of                   compliance with all privacy laws and regulations.

Seller shall be fully liable for the amounts paid                   by AEIS and/or their affiliates with respect to such Cards                   together with any additional reasonable costs incurred by AEIS                   and/or their affiliates arising out of such Cards.

Such Cards must be completely destroyed by                   cremating or shredding to the point where such Cards cannot be                   reconstructed in any way or Card numbers cannot be read in any                   way. Such destruction must be evidenced by execution of AEIS'                   Destruction Certificate, which is attached hereto as Schedule                   II. The Destruction Certificate shall be executed by Seller                   through two authorized signatures and shall particularly                   describe the Cards by (1) Card product name, (2) Card number,                   (3) denomination, (4) shipment tracking number, and (5)                   quantity by product and denomination, and account number.                   Seller shall pay AEIS associated destruction fees for such                   Card destruction as detailed within the Destruction                   Certificate.

In no event shall Seller throw away                   discard expired or spoiled or otherwise unwanted Cards in any                   other manner than described in this Section 2(n).

This                   Agreement shall be terminated by AEIS at AEIS' choice                   immediately upon Seller receiving a non-passing status of such                   security audit.

The rights of AEIS hereunder shall not be prejudiced or restricted by\n\n\n\n\n\nany time given or forbearance extended to Seller in the enforcement of          its rights and no waiver by AEIS of their rights in respect of any          breach hereof by Seller shall be deemed to operate as a waiver in          respect of any subsequent breach hereof.\n\n6.       It is agreed between the parties that if any provision of this          Agreement is held to be invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall          continue in full force and effect and shall be binding and effective on          the parties thereto.\n\n7.

Should this occur, we will notify you of any delay.\n\n26\n\nEXHIBIT 4.B\n\nAEIS MERCHANT APPROVAL GUIDELINES AND PROCESS\n\nINTRODUCTION / OVERVIEW\n\nThe AEIS Communications Group requires review of any new or revised materials, which include any mention of Merchant Partners -- in order to ensure proper merchant guidelines. This includes ALL advertising, promotional and marketing materials in any medium (INCLUDING: COMMUNICATIONS, ADVERTISING, SALES PROMOTION COLLATERAL, DIRECT MAIL, PRESS RELEASES, VIDEOS, WEB SITES, PROMOTIONAL ITEMS, SALES PRESENTATIONS AND SIMILAR MATERIALS.) Copy and layout should be submitted as early as possible. Due to the type of communications piece, approval could take anywhere from 3 to 10 business days.\n\nMERCHANT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION FOR APPROVAL GUIDELINES\n\nConsumer applications are typically more involved. Generally, consumer programs are targeted to a wider audience; therefore, the implications are greater for the merchant. For this reason, the merchants mandate that AEIS seek individual approvals from each and every merchant.\n\nAny standard applications using customized collateral should be reviewed by AEIS for content and accuracy. Even in the cases where standard program materials are to be used, AEIS will need to internally review any customized announcements and/or teasers. More than likely, these pieces feature only merchant names or merchant lists in print and can typically be approved within 24-48 hours.\n\nPieces using only select groups of merchants, photos or logos will generally require a higher level of approval and depending on the merchants used, may require approval from the merchant as well. The approval timeline will range from three to ten (3-10) business days for existing/ongoing.\n\nOnce, layout and copy are approved by AEIS Communications Group, Merchant Partnerships, Operations and American Express, any ongoing and additional changes must also be approved.\n\nIMAGES, LOGOS, PRODUCT PATENT, AND REGISTERED/SERVICE MARKS\n\nIMAGES AND LOGOS The following are examples of merchant image and logo usage, which require merchant approval through Merchant Partnerships:\n\no        Any communication or collateral, whether standard or customized,          containing merchant images or logos must be reviewed by Merchant          Partnerships o        Any new design work of merchant logos and images not previously          approved o        Use of standard merchant logos in any color other than the original          color o        Unique positioning of merchant images - surrounding merchants, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\no        \"Direct mail\" pieces, which include merchant references when only          \"select\" merchants are referenced. o        Unusual type of creative print work such as posters o        Borders around logos and busy backgrounds o        Any copy or tag-lines not previously approved o        Under no circumstances are press release photos to be used on or in          association with any form of communication relating to incentive card          programs unless approved by Merchant Partnerships' contact. o        Images and/or logos are not to be altered (cropped, inset, or overlaid)          unless approved by Merchant Partnerships' contact. o        All images used in magazine format must be obtain merchant copy write          information next to the image\n\nMERCHANT PARTNERSHIPS RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REMOVE IMAGES AT ANY TIME          THAT MAY BE DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE REPRESENTATION OF THE MERCHANT (THIS          INCLUDES OUTDATED OR SEASONAL IMAGES AND LOGOS).\n\nALL QUESTIONS REGARDING MERCHANT COMMUNICATION APPROVAL SHOULD BE          SUBMITTED TO ANN FINK AT ANN.FINK@AEIS.COM, 636-226-2043.\n\n27\n\nEXHIBIT 5\n\nCATEGORY CARD TARGET ACQUISITIONS\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PRIMARY CARD                              MARKETING CATEGORIES    TARGET MERCHANTS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONSUMER CATEGORIES: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Entertainment -

Upon any termination of this Agreement or, in the event of any Wind Down Period or Continuing Obligation period, upon the expiration of such period, and within fifteen (15) days after request by the disclosing party, each receiving party will return the Confidential Information of the other or destroy such Confidential Information and all copies of it and all information, records and materials developed therefrom, except that the recipient may retain one copy for archival purposes to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and nothing contained herein will require the erasure, deletion, alteration or destruction of any Confidential Information required to be retained for legal or regulatory purposes or stored on back-up tapes or other back-up media or archiving systems made in the ordinary course of business, subject in each case to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein. Each party may only disclose the general nature, but not the specific terms, of this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party; provided, however, either party may provide a copy of this Agreement or otherwise disclose its terms on a confidential basis in connection with any legal or regulatory requirement, financing transaction or due diligence inquiry. For clarity, in the event that use, disclosure or retention of any Confidential Information is required in order for DIALOG to exercise the license granted in Section 2, this Section 10 will not be deemed to prevent such use, disclosure or retention.\n\n  Page 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.3 Required Disclosure. Nothing herein will prevent a receiving party from disclosing all or part of the other's Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to court order, the lawful requirement of a governmental agency or when disclosure is required by operation of law (including disclosures pursuant to applicable securities laws or regulations thereunder); provided, that prior to any such disclosure, the receiving party will use reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify the disclosing party in writing of such requirement to disclose, and (b) cooperate fully with the disclosing party in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure or obtaining a protective order.   11. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMERS.   11.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties. ENERGOUS and DIALOG hereby each represent and warrant to the other that as of the Effective Date:   (a) it is a duly and validly organized and existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the state or country of its incorporation, as applicable, and that it is legally qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which this Agreement may be performed and the performance of its activities hereunder requires such qualification;   (b)  the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein will not result in any breach or violation of any terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents, or any material agreement or instrument to which it is a party, by which it is bound, or to which any of its property is subject;   (c) all requisite corporate action has been taken for the due authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by it, and this Agreement constitutes a legally binding obligation, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms, except insofar as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally; and\n\n  Page 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (d) it is not a party to any litigation relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to affect, its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.   11.2 Product Warranty.   (a)  ENERGOUS warrants that (i) when manufactured in accordance with the Approved Production Specifications, and as implemented in a suitable circuit application in accordance with the Product Specifications, the Products and Product Die will conform to the Product Specifications and will be free from defects that could have been avoided in their design; (ii) the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation and the Deposit Materials do not infringe any third party's Intellectual Property Rights; (iii) it did not misappropriate any third party's trade secrets in the development of the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation or the Deposit Materials; and (iv) when delivered (including any software updates if any), no Product will contain any viruses, \"Trojan horses\" or other harmful code. The above warranties are valid for a period of [***] from the date of shipment of any Licensed Product to any customer.   (b) The warranty contained in Section 11.2(a) does not apply to the extent any Product is operated in a manner other than that specified by the Product Specifications, is treated with abuse, negligence or other improper treatment (including, without limitation, use outside the device maximum ratings, package MSL (moisture sensitivity level) guidelines or environmental limits as may be set forth in the Product Specifications), or is defective as a result of any materials or workmanship of the Manufacturing Subcontractors or failure of the Manufacturing Subcontractors to manufacture the Product according to Approved Production Specifications. As such, any warranty claims due to defects in build, materials or workmanship will be directed to the Manufacturing Subcontractors as part of that contract between DIALOG or, if applicable, its Affiliate and such parties.   (c) With the exception of the warranties in Section 11.2(a)(ii) (third party IP infringement) and Section 11.2(a)(iii) (misappropriation of third party trade secrets) related to any Product Die, the warranties in this Section 11.2 do not apply to MCMs or repackaged Product Die developed by or for DIALOG or its Affiliates.   (d) In the event any warranty claim is due to or arises from an Epidemic Defect, ENERGOUS will be responsible for all costs and expenses directly incurred by DIALOG or its Affiliates or their respective customers as a result of reasonable inspection, servicing, repairs, replacements, recall notices, recalls and responses with respect thereto, provided that ENERGOUS' aggregate liability to DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers under this paragraph (d) will not exceed [***] per occurrence of an Epidemic Defect. Each party will immediately notify the other upon becoming aware of the circumstance that could reasonably be construed to be an indication of an Epidemic Defect, and, in any event, will notify the other party immediately upon becoming aware of the existence of an Epidemic Defect. ENERGOUS and DIALOG will expeditiously work together in good faith to determine a technical resolution of the Epidemic Failure. ENERGOUS agrees to make all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly diagnose the Epidemic Failure's root cause, provide DIALOG a report detailing the results of ENERGOUS' investigation and plan an effective workaround and a permanent solution. ENERGOUS will consult with DIALOG on any proposed workarounds and other solutions.   * Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n  Page 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11.3  Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. If any of the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials is, or in ENERGOUS' or DIALOG's opinion is likely to become, the subject of an Intellectual Property Rights infringement claim, and as a result DIALOG or any of its Affiliates or their respective customers are enjoined, or in ENERGOUS' or DIALOG's opinion are likely to be enjoined, from using the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, ENERGOUS will use its best efforts to:   (a) procure for DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers the right to continue to use the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable; or, but only in the event that, despite ENERGOUS' best efforts to do so, ENERGOUS is unable to so procure such right,   (b) replace or modify the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable, to make them non-infringing, provided that the replaced or modified Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials remain substantially similar in performance to the infringing Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials.   If none of the foregoing alternatives is available within a commercially reasonable time period, DIALOG may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect, provided that it will give ENERGOUS prompt prior written notice thereof. Nothing in this Section 11.3 is intended to limit DIALOG's rights to indemnification under Section 12 in connection with any such infringement claim.   11.4  Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 11, THE PRODUCTS, THE PRODUCT IP, TOOLING, DOCUMENTATION, DEPOSIT MATERIALS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND ALL LICENSES, SERVICES AND OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED BY A PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. EXCEPT FOR THOSE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE.   12. INDEMNIFICATION.   12.1 Indemnification by Energous. Subject to Section 12.2, ENERGOUS agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, in the case of any third party claims, defend DIALOG and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, distributors and customers (collectively, \"DIALOG Indemnitees\") from and against and in respect of any and all alleged or actual demands, claims, actions, causes of action, suits or proceedings, assessments, awarded damages (including punitive damages), liabilities, interest and penalties, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and disbursements in connection therewith) (each, a \"Claim\") to the extent resulting from, arising out of, relating to, or imposed upon or incurred by any DIALOG Indemnitees by reason of (a) death or bodily injury caused by or resulting from use of the Products, (b) any breach of any representation or warranty made by ENERGOUS hereunder or to any third party in relation to the Products or Product Die, (c) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights in relation to the Products or Product Die, (d) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights as a result of DIALOG's or its Affiliates' exercise of rights in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Manufacturing Subcontractors' manufacture of the Products on their behalf, provided that the Products are manufactured in strict compliance with the Product Specifications and Approved Production Specifications and only to the extent such Claims arise due to compliance with the Product Specifications and/or the Approved Production Specifications or use of the Tooling provided by ENERGOUS hereunder, (e) the infringement by DIALOG of any third party Marks rights as a result of its authorized use of the ENERGOUS Marks, (f) any failure by ENERGOUS to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, or (g) ENERGOUS' negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud.\n\n  Page 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.2 Exclusion. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.1, ENERGOUS will not be liable to the extent any Claim results from (a) modification of the Products by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party (including the Manufacturing Subcontractors), or combination of the Products with other products, offered by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party, (b) acts or omissions of any Manufacturing Subcontractor (except to the extent such Claims are due to the infringement or misappropriation of third party Intellectual Property Rights arising from such Manufacturing Subcontractor's manufacturing of the Products on behalf of DIALOG in strict compliance with the Product Specifications, Approved Production Specifications and Tooling provided by ENERGOUS), (c) failure of any DIALOG Indemnitee to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, or (d) negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud of any DIALOG Indemnitee. For clarification, if any of the foregoing is not the cause, in whole or in part of the Claim, ENERGOUS is not relieved of its obligations under Section 12.1.   12.3 Conditions. DIALOG must notify ENERGOUS within thirty (30) business days after receipt of actual notice of any Claim by a third party for which it seeks indemnification; provided, however, any failure or delay in notice will not relieve ENERGOUS of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that ENERGOUS is actually prejudiced by such failure to notify. ENERGOUS will have control and authority with respect to the defense, litigation, compromise or settlement of such third party Claim (except to the extent that any settlement involves any commitments, responsibilities or obligations on the part of DIALOG, in which case such settlement will require the prior written consent of DIALOG, which consent will not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld). DIALOG will cooperate and provide assistance and information as may reasonably be required by ENERGOUS (but at ENERGOUS' expense) in connection therewith. DIALOG reserves the right to participate at its own cost in any third party proceedings with counsel of its own choosing. In the event that ENERGOUS does not respond to any third party Claim or does not sufficiently defend such third party Claim, DIALOG, acting reasonably, may step in and take over the defense of such Claim. Costs incurred in the settlement of any Claim, including, but not limited to, reasonable legal expenses, may be off set against future Royalties and Service Fees payable.\n\n  Page 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.4 Insurance. Each party will maintain, during the Term and for three (3) years thereafter, such comprehensive general liability insurance (including without limitation, products liability) as will adequately protect it against its potential liabilities under this Agreement, in amounts customary in the semiconductor industry for similar services and products. Each party will, at the other party's request, provide to the other party a certificate of insurance evidencing the foregoing insurance coverage.   13.

Each party will comply with all law and regulations applicable such party's performance under this Agreement, including but not limited to U.S. Export Administration laws and regulations and any other export, import and re-export control laws applicable to such party. The parties will refrain from exporting or re-exporting the Products or Product IP or any technical data or other materials received from each other, or the direct product of any of these, to any country, individual or organization proscribed by the United States government, unless properly authorized by the appropriate agencies of the United States government.

ENERGOUS will at its expense, at DIALOG's written request during the Term and any Wind Down Period, enter into a three- party escrow deposit arrangement, in accordance with this Section 16, with a recognized escrow agent (the \"Escrow Agent\") of mutual agreement. ENERGOUS will keep the Deposit Materials in escrow and ensure on a quarterly basis that all the information relating to the Deposit Materials in escrow is current, including deposit of any Product Updates.   16.2 Release of Deposit Materials. In the event of any Insolvency Event and where the design files need to be accessed by DIALOG to fix an Epidemic Defect or other Product design or production issue impacting yield or quality (\"Release Condition\"), the Escrow Agent will, in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement between the parties and the Escrow Agent (the \"Escrow Agreement\"), release the Deposit Materials to DIALOG.   16.3 License.

The licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement are license to rights in \"intellectual property\" (as that term is defined in Section 101 of the United States Bankruptcy Code) and governed by 11 USC Section 365(n). Accordingly, if a trustee in bankruptcy rejects the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement as executory contracts, then Company may elect to retain its rights under this Agreement in accordance with and subject to the provisions of 11 USC Section 365(n).\n\n  Page 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  17. PUBLICITY.   17.1 Publicity.

ENERGOUS and DIALOG acknowledge and agree that the covenants in this Section 18 are reasonable and necessary to protect each of their trade secrets, Confidential Information and stable workforces.   19. CHOICE OF LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION.   19.1 Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of conflict of laws principles.   19.2 Dispute Resolution; Jurisdiction. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any matters regarding its existence, scope, validity, breach or termination, or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or related to it) that is not able to be resolved through negotiations will be submitted to arbitration in San Francisco, California, administered by the International Chamber of Commerce under its Rules of Arbitration. There will be one arbitrator. The language of the arbitration will be English. The award will be in writing, state the reasons for the award and be final and binding. Judgment on the award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as may be required by law, the parties will preserve the confidentiality of all aspects of the arbitration. The arbitration will be the sole and exclusive forum for final resolution of any such dispute or claim, provided, however, that, because each party will have access to and become acquainted with Confidential Information of the other party, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which may cause irreparable harm and significant injury which may be difficult to ascertain and which may not be compensable by damages alone, the parties agree that the damaged party will have the right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that it may have for such unauthorized use or disclosure. Each party irrevocably waives all rights to a jury trial in any judicial proceeding permitted hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the validity, construction, and enforceability of this Agreement and the resolution of disputes arising out of and relating to this Agreement, will be governed solely by this Section 19.   * Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n  Page 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  20.

Vyera shall deduct and withhold from the Payments any taxes that it is required by Applicable Law to deduct or withhold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CytoDyn is entitled under any applicable tax treaty to a reduction of rate of, or the elimination of, or recovery of, applicable withholding tax, it may deliver to Vyera or the appropriate Governmental Authority the prescribed forms necessary to reduce the applicable rate of withholding or to relieve Vyera of its obligation to withhold tax. In such case Vyera shall apply the reduced rate of withholding, or not withhold, as the case may be, provided that Vyera is in receipt of evidence, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Vyera, for example CytoDyn's delivery of all required documentation at least five (5) Business Days prior to the time that the Payments are due.

From the date of the Arbitration Request and until such time as the dispute has become finally settled, the running of the time periods as to which a Party must cure a breach of this Agreement becomes suspended as to the subject matter of the dispute. Unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing, during the period of time that any arbitration proceeding is pending under this Agreement, the Parties shall continue to comply with all those terms and provisions of this Agreement that are not the subject of the pending arbitration proceeding. (c) Within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of the Arbitration Request, the other Party may, by written notice, add additional issues for resolution; provided, that such issues have been subject to Section 12.2 and relate directly to the matter that is the subject of the applicable Arbitration Request. (d) The arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Large Complex Disputes as modified below, unless the matter in dispute has a value of at least $50,000,000 and either Party wishes to have the arbitration conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators. The arbitrator(s) shall be experienced in the subject matter of the Arbitration Request as it applies to the biotechnology or pharmaceutical business. The Parties shall cooperate to attempt to select the arbitrator(s) by agreement within twenty (20) days of the initiation of arbitration. If agreement cannot be reached within such twenty (20) days, then that AAA will submit a list of twenty (20) qualified arbitrators from which each Party shall strike unacceptable entries; provided that each Party shall not strike more than thirty-five percent (35%) of the names without cause, and rank the remaining names. The AAA shall appoint the arbitrator(s) with the highest combined ranking(s). If these procedures fail to result in selection of the required number of arbitrators, the AAA shall appoint the arbitrator(s), allowing each side challenges for cause. The arbitration shall be held in New York, New York and all proceedings and communications shall be conducted in English. The Parties shall each use their best efforts to have the arbitration hearing held as soon as practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days after the selection of the arbitrator(s).

The proposed ruling shall be limited to proposed rulings and remedies on each issue, and shall contain no argument on or analysis of the facts or issues. Within five (5) Business Days after close of the hearing, each Party may submit a post-hearing brief (up to five (5) pages) to the arbitrator(s). (e) Either Party may apply first to the arbitrator(s) for interim injunctive relief until the arbitration decision is rendered or the arbitration matter is otherwise resolved; provided, that if such Party determines that such injunctive relief cannot be awarded in a timeframe adequate to protect such Party's interests, then a Party may, without waiving any right or remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any injunctive or provisional relief necessary to protect the rights or property of that Party pending resolution of the arbitration matter pursuant to this Section 12.3. The arbitrators shall have no\n\nSource: CYTODYN INC., 10-Q, 1/9/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nauthority to award punitive or any other type of damages not measured by a Party's compensatory damages. The Parties further agree that the decision of the arbitrators shall be the sole, exclusive and binding remedy between them regarding determination of arbitration matters presented. (f) The Parties hereby agree that any disputed performance or suspended performance pending the resolution of an arbitration matter that the arbitrators determine to be required to be performed by a Party must be completed within a reasonable time period following the final decision of the arbitrators. (g) Each Party shall bear its own attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the arbitrators; provided, however, that the arbitrators shall be authorized to determine whether a Party is the prevailing Party, and if so, to award to that prevailing Party reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (including, for example, expert witness fees and expenses, photocopy charges and travel expenses), and/or the fees and costs of the arbitrators. (h) Except to the extent necessary to confirm an award or decision or as may be required by Applicable Laws, neither a Party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of an arbitration without the prior written consent of both Parties.

Reserved Disputes shall not include disputes with respect to the interpretation, breach, termination or invalidity of this Agreement. [***]\n\n12.5 Preliminary Injunctions.

During the pendency of any Dispute resolution proceeding between the Parties under this Article 12, the obligation to make any payment under this Agreement from one Party to the other Party, which payment is the subject, in whole or in part, of a proceeding under this Article 12, shall be tolled until the final outcome of such Dispute has been established. Any undisputed payment obligations (including undisputed portions of a payment obligation that is subject to a proceeding under this Article 12) shall not be tolled during such Dispute.\n\nSource: CYTODYN INC., 10-Q, 1/9/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n12.8 Confidentiality.

Vyera hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless CytoDyn and its Affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (each, a \"CytoDyn Indemnitee\") from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, demands, liabilities, expenses and/or losses, including reasonable legal expenses and attorneys' fees (collectively, the \"Losses\"), to which any CytoDyn Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any Third Party (each, a \"Claim\") to the extent such Losses arise directly or indirectly out of: (a) the breach by Vyera of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by Vyera in this Agreement; (b) Commercialization activities undertaken by or on behalf of Vyera or its Affiliates; (c) the negligence, gross negligence, illegal conduct or willful misconduct of Vyera or its Affiliate, or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative thereof; except, with respect to each of subsections (a), (b) and (c) above, to the extent such Losses arise directly or indirectly from the negligence, gross negligence, illegal conduct or willful misconduct of any CytoDyn Indemnitee or the breach by CytoDyn of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by CytoDyn in this Agreement.\n\n13.2 Indemnification by CytoDyn. CytoDyn hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Vyera and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (each, a \"Vyera Indemnitee\") from and against any and all Losses to which any Vyera Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any Claim to the extent such Losses arise directly or indirectly out of: (a) the breach by CytoDyn of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by CytoDyn in this Agreement; (b) the negligence, gross negligence, illegal conduct, or willful misconduct of CytoDyn or its Affiliate or its licensee (other than Vyera or its Affiliate), or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative thereof; or (c) subject to Section 8.7, the infringement of Third Party Patents or the misappropriation of Third Party Know-How by the sale, offer for sale or use of any Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory; except, with respect to each of subsections (a), (b) or (c) above, to the extent such Losses arise directly or indirectly from the negligence, gross negligence, illegal conduct or willful misconduct of any Vyera Indemnitee or the breach by Vyera of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by Vyera in this Agreement.\n\nSource: CYTODYN INC., 10-Q, 1/9/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3 Indemnification Procedures. (a) Notice. Promptly after a CytoDyn Indemnitee or a Vyera Indemnitee (each, an \"Indemnitee\") receives notice of a pending or threatened Claim, such Indemnitee shall give written notice of the Claim to the Party from whom the Indemnitee is entitled to receive indemnification pursuant to Sections 13.1 or 13.2, as applicable (the \"Indemnifying Party\"). However, an Indemnitee's delay in providing or failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent it can demonstrate actual prejudice due to the delay or lack of notice. (b) Defense. Upon receipt of notice under this Section 13.3 from the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party will have the duty to either compromise or defend, at its own expense and by counsel (reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee) such Claim. The Indemnifying Party will promptly (and in any event not more than twenty (20) days after receipt of the Indemnitee's original notice) notify the Indemnitee in writing that it acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to the Claim pursuant to this Article 13 and of its intention either to compromise or defend such Claim. Once the Indemnifying Party gives such notice to the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party is not liable to the Indemnitee for the fees of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such defense, other than the Indemnitee's reasonable out of pocket Third Party expenses related to its investigation and cooperation, except as otherwise provided in the next sentence. As to all Claims as to which the Indemnifying Party has assumed control under this Section 13.3(b), the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of a Claim (as reasonably directed by the Indemnifying Party) at its own expense; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded, based upon a written opinion from outside legal counsel, that there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee in the defense of such Claim, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of one (1) law firm serving as counsel for the Indemnitee in relation to such Third Party Claim. (c) Cooperation. The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of any Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnitee informed on a reasonable and timely basis as to the status of such Claim (to the extent the Indemnitee is not participating in the defense of such Claim) and conduct the defense of such Claim in a prudent manner. (d) Settlement. If an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Claim, no compromise or settlement of such Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnitee's written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee's consent shall not be required of a settlement where: (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnitee; (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; (iii) the Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement are not adversely affected; and (iv) there is a full release of the Indemnitee from such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume defense of a Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnitee may settle such Claim on such terms as it deems appropriate with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for such settlement as provided in this Article 13. It is understood that only Vyera and CytoDyn may claim indemnification under this Agreement (on its own behalf or on behalf of its Indemnitees), and other Indemnitees may not directly claim indemnity under this Agreement.\n\nSource: CYTODYN INC., 10-Q, 1/9/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n13.4 Insurance. Each Party, at its own expense, shall maintain comprehensive general liability, product liability and other appropriate insurance for the activities such Party undertakes pursuant to this Agreement, from reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other Party upon request. Such insurance will not create a limit to a Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article 13 or otherwise. This Section 13.4 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for the period in which the Licensed Product is being Commercialized by or on behalf of Vyera plus six (6) years. Each Party shall provide the other Party with prompt written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal or material change in such insurance that could materially adversely affect the rights of the other Party hereunder, and shall provide such notice within thirty (30) days after any such cancellation, non-renewal or material change.\n\n13.5 Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR A PARTY'S OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE 13, AND ANY BREACH OF ARTICLE 10 (CONFIDENTIALITY), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (OR THE OTHER PARTY'S AFFILIATES OR SUBLICENSEES) IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT FOR LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, LOST ROYALTIES, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, DAMAGE TO GOODWILL, OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR INDIRECT DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR STRICT LIABILITY, EVEN IF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN PLACED ON NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This Agreement and all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any breach hereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement\n\n14.3 Designation of Affiliates. Each Party may discharge any obligation and exercise any right hereunder through delegation of its obligations or rights to any of its Affiliates. Each Party hereby guarantees the performance by its Affiliates of such Party's obligations under this Agreement, and shall cause its Affiliates to comply with the provisions of this Agreement in connection with such performance. Any breach by a Party's Affiliate of any of such Party's obligations under this Agreement shall be deemed a breach by such Party, and the other Party may proceed directly against such Party without any obligation to first proceed against such Party's Affiliate.\n\n14.4 Relationship of the Parties. It is expressly agreed that CytoDyn, on the one hand, and Vyera, on the other hand, shall be independent contractors and that the relationship between the two Parties shall not constitute a partnership, joint venture or agency, including for tax purposes. Neither CytoDyn nor Vyera shall have the authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other, without the prior written consent of the other Party to do so. All persons employed by a Party shall be employees of that Party and not of the other Party and all costs and obligations incurred by reason of such employment shall be at the expense of such Party.\n\n14.5 Force Majeure. Both Parties shall be excused from the performance of their obligations under this Agreement to the extent that such performance is prevented by Force Majeure and the nonperforming Party promptly provides notice of the prevention to the other Party. Such excuse shall be continued so long as the condition constituting Force Majeure continues and the nonperforming Party takes reasonable efforts to remove the condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party shall not be excused from making payments owed hereunder because of a Force Majeure affecting such Party. If a Force Majeure persists for more than [***], then the Parties shall discuss in good faith the modification of the Parties' obligations under this Agreement in order to mitigate the delays caused by such Force Majeure.\n\nSource: CYTODYN INC., 10-Q, 1/9/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n14.6 Assignment. Vyera may not assign this Agreement, or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of CytoDyn, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed provided that Vyera may assign this Agreement without CytoDyn's consent to an Affiliate or to a successor to substantially all of the business of Vyera to which this Agreement relates. A Change of Control shall be deemed an assignment for purposes of this Agreement. Any permitted successor or assignee of rights and/or obligations permitted hereunder shall, in writing to the other Party, expressly assume performance of such rights and/or obligations. Any permitted assignment shall be binding on the successors of the assigning Party. Any assignment or attempted assignment by Vyera in violation of the terms of this Section 14.6 shall be null, void and of no legal effect. For clarity, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Vyera from undergoing any Change of Control, but if Vyera undergoes a Change of Control, it will be subject to Section 2.6. CytoDyn may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole but not in part, to any Third Party not in a materially worse (financially and otherwise) of performing CytoDyn's obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Vyera (it being understood that any other assignment of this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder shall require the prior written consent of Vyera, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).\n\n14.7 Severability. If any one (1) or more of the provisions of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be or is taken, the provision(s) shall be considered severed from this Agreement and shall not serve to invalidate any remaining provisions hereof. The Parties shall make a good faith effort to replace any invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision such that the objectives contemplated by the Parties when entering this Agreement may be realized.\n\n14.8 Waiver and Non-Exclusion of Remedies. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. The waiver by either Party hereto of any right hereunder or of the failure to perform or of a breach by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other right hereunder or of any other breach or failure by such other Party whether of a similar nature or otherwise. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and do not exclude any other right or remedy provided by Applicable Law or otherwise available except as expressly set forth herein.\n\n14.9 Further Assurance. Each Party shall duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further instruments and do and cause to be done such further acts and things, including the filing of such assignments, agreements, documents, and instruments, as may be necessary or as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement or to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof.\n\n14.10 Headings.

Contractor shall not replace at its initiative key Personnel                     during the duration of this Agreement, to the extent such                     replacement shall materially impair its ability to perform                     in compliance herewith and any such replacement shall take                     place only after consultation with NICE. It is agreed for                     the purpose hereof, that frequent replacement of key                     personnel shall be deemed as materially impairing                     Contractor's ability to perform hereunder. NICE may reject                     on reasonable grounds any such key personnel employed by                     Contractor in the performance of its obligations hereunder,                     and they shall be replaced by Contractor promptly following                     NICE' first reasoned request.

The project manager will not be replaced                     at Contractor's initiative during the duration of this                     Agreement to the extent such replacement shall\n\n                                       9\n\n                    materially impair Contractors ability to perform in                     compliance herewith and any such replacement shall take                     place only after consultation with NICE. It is agreed for                     the purpose hereof, that frequent replacement of                     Contractor's Project Manager shall be deemed as materially                     impairing Contractor's ability to perform hereunder. The                     project manager will meet with NICE' representative on a                     regular basis.\n\n               1.2.5. CONTROL AND PLANNING.

Contractor will provide NICE with reports on a                     daily/ weekly/ monthly basis, as follows: the reports will                     present all relevant details regarding the production                     orders, time between phases, disassembled Products,                     schedules, logistics reports, etc. The reports provided will\n\n\n\n\n\n                    present all said data in a clear manner and will include                     graphic presentations. The reports will enable NICE to                     verify that all systems are matched and to verify the                     improvement that is achieved by Contractor. All said reports                     shall need to be agreed in advance by both Parties.\n\n               1.2.6. SUPERVISION AND MONITORING. NICE shall be entitled but not                     obligated, to supervise and monitor the execution of this                     Agreement from time to time as set forth herein.

QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. The Manufacturing                     Outsourcing Services performed by Contractor shall be                     executed according to and comply with all quality control                     requirements and specifications described in APPENDIX J.                     Without derogating from Contractor's responsibility as                     aforementioned, NICE reserves the right to execute quality                     assurance inspection on Contractor's premises, all as                     described in APPENDIX J and according to the terms hereof.\n\n               1.2.9.

STEERING COMMITTEE. The Parties will appoint a steering                     committee which shall monitor the execution of this                     Agreement, comprised of Contractor's project manager, NICE'                     representative, and relevant personnel of the Parties.\n\n     2.   COMPONENTS PURCHASING, NICE COMPONENTS AND INVENTORY.\n\n          2.1. COMPONENTS PURCHASING. Upon transition to the third phase -                Production, the Contractor will be responsible for all purchasing                of components and getting equipped with all the materials                necessary for the assembly of the Products (except the Non                Generic Equipment). At NICE' request, and without derogating from                any other provisions of this Agreement, Contractor shall promptly                notify NICE, in writing, who are the suppliers of any specific                components and under what agreements purchase is effected.\n\n          2.2. CONTRACTOR PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. Without derogating from the                aforementioned, NICE may, at its sole discretion, decide to be                involved and to actively or inactively, participate in                negotiations and purchasing agreements of Contractor for                components designated for production hereunder. In such event,                Contractor will comply with NICE' requirements and instructions                and contract accordingly, without imposing any liability on NICE,                provided such instructions\n\n                                       11\n\n               are in accordance with common purchasing practice and in                accordance with this Agreement. NICE may, at its election,                instruct Contractor not to purchase a relevant component from a                specific supplier, provided an alternative supplier exists.                APPENDIX C shall be updated accordingly. At NICE' request,                Contractor shall notify any relevant supplier that it is                purchasing components for NICE Products and shall further furnish                the supplier with information requested by such supplier. In any                event, Contractor shall report to NICE on its purchasing                negotiations and achievements and shall supply NICE, at NICE'                request, with a copy of all relevant existing documentation.\n\n          2.3. FLEXTRONICS, INC. GLOBAL PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. Nevertheless, in                the event that the purchase agreement is signed by Flextronics,                Inc. as a global purchase agreement for the Flextronics group,                and not as a local agreement of Contractor or as an agreement                applying to NICE required components only, then NICE will not                participate in the negotiations and will not be entitled to                receive copies of such agreement/s. The details relevant to the                components purchased under an agreement as above will be included\n\n\n\n\n\n               in APPENDIX C and Contractor hereby declares and undertakes that                the details included in APPENDIX C (as amended from time to time                according to the provisions of this Agreement) shall be the                accurate details from the Flextronics, Inc. global purchase                agreements and components and sub assembly prices in APPENDIX C                shall be net purchase prices of Contractor without any overhead                or uplift. NICE shall be entitled, at its sole discretion, to                object in advance to Contractor using any Flextronics, Inc.                global purchase agreement and in such event, Contractor shall                purchase the components separately, the provisions of Section                2.2. shall apply and APPENDIX C shall be updated accordingly.                Contractor undertakes to comply with NICE' instructions and the                manufacturer license terms regarding the use and duplication of                Microsoft and other third party software supplied by NICE and not                to use such software products for any purpose other than in the                assembly of the Products. Contractor will copy from the master CD                of those software products only the exact number of licenses                designated by NICE in writing and for which a license has been                issued by NICE.\n\n          2.4. NICE DESIGNATED COMPONENTS. NICE may request Contractor to                purchase specific components from specific suppliers, provided                that the terms of such suppliers are in accordance with common                purchasing practices and APPENDIX C shall be updated accordingly.\n\n               When purchasing components for Contractor's other customers,                Contractor may not represent itself to the suppliers as a NICE                outsourcer for the purposes of such purchase.\n\n          2.5. NICE SUPPLIED COMPONENTS. NICE may, at its election, supply to                Contractor software licenses and software or the like for which                NICE has an existing royalty agreement with a third party (except                electrical and mechanical components unless agreed otherwise), in                lieu of Contractor purchasing same (\"NICE COMPONENTS\"). All\n\n                                       12\n\n               such components will be delivered to Contractor in a mutually                agreed package type, and in an agreed upon time and in agreed                upon quantities. The parties will agree on the inventory level                required by Contractor for each NICE Component and NICE' sole                responsibility shall be to renew the inventory upon request.                Contractor shall be responsible for ordering additional NICE                Components if required above the inventory level and for ensuring                that appropriate physical controls of such components are in                place and properly administered. Contractor will not charge NICE                any charges or overhead for such NICE Components. In the event                Contractor has difficulty in purchasing any components which NICE                can obtain and NICE has granted its consent to supply such                component to Contractor in lieu of Contractor purchasing same,                Contractor will not charge NICE any charges or overhead for such                Components.\n\n          2.6. INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND USE OF EXISTING INVENTORY. All                purchasing of inventory, use of inventory, and management of                inventory shall be performed by Contractor according to this                Agreement, and APPENDIX C.\n\n          2.7. EXISTING NICE INVENTORY. Furthermore, Contractor will purchase                from NICE its existing inventory of components available for use                in Products for up to six (6) months on a rolling basis, as                detailed in APPENDIX F, all of which will be transferred to                Contractor's facility on the purchase date, all as detailed                hereunder: On the Effective Date Contractor will purchase the                inventory included in part I of APPENDIX F. Regarding the                remainder of the inventory included in part II of APPENDIX F the                following will apply: at the beginning of the first production                Quarter hereunder Contractor will purchase the components                required under the Forecast issued by NICE for that Quarter                regardless of the Total Lead Time for such components; at the                beginning of the second production Quarter hereunder Contractor                will purchase the components required under the Forecast issued                by NICE for that Quarter regardless of the Total Lead Time for                such components; Contractor will purchase any components                remaining in APPENDIX F after two Quarters as aforementioned, on                a current basis as required under the Forecast issued by NICE for                the following Quarters but in compliance with the Total Lead Time                for such components. Contractor will use said NICE' inventory for                the production of the Products rather than purchase such                components from third parties, until full use of all NICE                inventory. Contractor shall pay NICE the purchase price of such                components, as set forth in APPENDIX C hereto, and under payment                terms as set forth in Section 8.4. When sold to NICE as part of                aProduct, the component prices paid by NICE to Contractor                hereunder will be calculated with a reduced overhead of 2%. NICE                will and does hereby provide Contractor with all such warranties                with respect to the components sold thereby as is required from                Contractor under this Agreement with respect to the same                components. Furthermore, without derogating from NICE'                undertakings hereunder, Contractor will use its international                supply chain in order to assist NICE in selling its dead                inventory, which is not included in APPENDIX F, and the proceeds                from such sales will be shared as follows: 10% Contractor, 90%                NICE. Contractor will report to NICE regularly, on such sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\n          2.8. COMPONENT END OF LIFE. Contractor shall take all necessary                measures in order to receive immediate updates from its suppliers                regarding end of life of any component (i.e types of components                which shall no longer be manufactured). Contractor shall notify                NICE immediately upon becoming aware of the event of end of life                of a component. In such event, NICE shall designate and approve                the replacement components to be used instead and the Parties                will mutually agree on the required changes in APPENDIX C.\n\n          2.9. COMPONENTS FOR NICE INTERNAL REQUIREMENTS. Contractor will                occasionally provide services in order to help NICE to obtain                components for NICE' internal requirements. Contractor will allow                NICE to purchase reasonable quantities from its available                inventory at a price agreed in advance, and will help NICE to                obtain components from manufacturers/suppliers at the lowest                available price (in the case where the components in question are                not in the Contractor's inventory).\n\n          2.10. It is clarified that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent                NICE from contracting directly with Contractor's suppliers and                vendors in any agreement, or from purchasing identical                components, whether during this Agreement or following its                termination or expiration.\n\n     3.   ORDERING AND OTHER MATTERS\n\n          3.1. FORECASTS. NICE shall give Contractor a written forecast of the                Products, by type, quantity and expected Due Date (the                \"FORECAST\") as follows: A Forecast shall be a rolling forecast                for the current Quarter and the two (2) consecutive Quarters,                detailed by week. Upon the Effective Date, NICE shall deliver a                Forecast for the period commencing on the expected completion of                the Relocation Phase for the first Product, for the current                Quarter and for the next coming two Quarters and so on thereafter                during the term of this Agreement. The Forecast may be updated by                NICE on a weekly basis, or more frequently (at NICE' discretion).\n\n               A Forecast will not be deemed to constitute a binding purchase                order with respect to Products (as opposed to components and                sub-assemblies, as set forth in Sections 3.4, 16 and 17.5 of this                Agreement). Contractor will manufacture the quantities of                Products only according to specific orders and the Production                Lead Time. The\n\n                                       14\n\n               Parties' responsibilities and undertakings arising from NICE'                Forecast shall be according to APPENDIX C as amended from time to                time according to the provisions of this Agreement. Liability                reports will be submitted by Contractor on the 1st of each                calendar month and will need to be approved by NICE. It is                clarified for the avoidance of doubt, that in any event, any and                all purchase obligations of NICE with respect to Products (as                opposed to components and sub-assemblies) are limited in any                given time during the term of this Agreement, to the PO's only.\n\n               Contractor (with NICE' participation) will implement, at its own                expense, a full process of Demand Flow Technology, including: (I)                Product Synchronization; (II) Sequence of Events; (III) Mix                Model; (IV) Demand of Capacity & Take Time; (V) Operations                grouping; (VI) Line Design & Balancing. This process will help to                determine the Sub Assembly Lead Time and the Production Lead                Time. It is clarified that any change in the Production Lead Time                detailed in this Agreement shall require NICE' prior written                approval; any change in the Sub Assembly Lead Time detailed in                this Agreement as a result of which the maximum Sub Assembly Lead                Time for the relevant sub-assembly exceeds 30 Days, shall require                NICE' prior written approval.\n\n          3.2. PURCHASE ORDERS AND ISSUING ORDERS. NICE shall, from                time-to-time, issue to Contractor a Purchase Order, according to                the Forecast, for Products, by type, quantity and Due Date, as                and when it desires to order Products. PO's will be issued at                least two (2) weeks prior to the designated Due Date. Each and                every order will be entered in NICE' logistic system as a Sales                Order. Every Product shall be manufactured according to the                Production Lead Time. Commencement of assembly shall be based on                Production Lead Times (as per Section A (xvii)) and calculated to                meet NICE' delivery requirements. It is clarified that delivery                and shipment of Products and NICE' obligation to pay for Products                shall only be according to a PO.\n\n               Purchase Orders for Products (and Forecasts for Products) may be                delivered to Contractor by any reasonable means, including but                not limited to e-mail, computerized systems, etc., postal                delivery, courier delivery, facsimile transmission, as shall be                notified by NICE in writing and in advance of any relevant PO.                For the removal of doubt, a PO shall not be binding upon                Contractor until Contractor has confirmed in writing receipt of                the PO. Contractor shall, within two Business Days of its receipt                of a Purchase Order, accept or reject such Purchase Order in                writing; provided, however, that Contractor shall be obligated to\n\n\n\n\n\n               accept all Purchase Orders issued in accordance with the terms                hereof for Products with respect to which a price per the                quantity ordered has been mutually agreed by the parties.                Contractor undertakes that in the event of increase in Product                requirements VIS-A-VIS the Forecast (i.e. issuance of PO's                exceeding\n\n                                       15\n\n               the relevant Forecast), Contractor's manufacturing capacity can                be increased, at any time, by thirty percent (30%) beyond the                then current Forecast. In addition, in as much as purchase of                components and purchase of sub assemblies are concerned, NICE may                order Products, which are not included in the Forecast, and                Contractor will make its best reasonable commercial efforts to                accommodate such order in accordance with NICE' request. It is                clarified that in any event Contractor will accept all PO's                exceeding the Forecast, subject to updating the Due Date based                upon the Total Lead Time for obtaining the required components,                which are not available in Contractor's inventory. The Due Date                for such PO's will be determined according to the time of                obtaining the components. For components/Products the prices for                which are not previously agreed under APPENDIX C, the price will                be agreed in writing prior to acceptance of the PO.\n\n          3.3. FORECAST REVIEW. The parties shall hold weekly meetings, in                person, at NICE' facility or by conference phone call, for the                purpose of discussing NICE' existing and contemplated Forecasts                and order requirements and updating the Forecast; provided,                however, only written Forecasts and Purchase Orders, or written                modifications thereto, shall bind NICE and Contractor pursuant to                the terms of this Agreement or otherwise. The parties, as                business requirements dictate, may mutually agree upon the use of                blanket purchase orders for specific sub-assemblies or components                (exceeding the requirements under Forecasts), subject to the                terms of this Agreement and such sub-assemblies or components                purchased shall be deemed Permitted Components.\n\n          3.4. PERMITTED COMPONENTS. Contractor may make purchase commitments to                suppliers and assemble components to sub-assemblies based upon                the Forecasts received from NICE but subject always to the Total                Lead Time, Liability and ABC policies of Contractor (which NICE                will be entitled to review and comment on in advance of the                relevant purchase). Contractor shall maintain inventory of                Permitted Components (as defined below) for use during the                Production Lead Time. NICE shall only be obligated to Contractor                for components and sub-assemblies ordered and assembled by                Contractor, in accordance with the Forecast and in compliance                always with the Total Lead Time as detailed in APPENDIX C (as                amended from time to time according to this Agreement) or                otherwise for inventory of components purchased from NICE under                Sections 2.7 or 3.4(A), or purchased in accordance with POs,                ECO's or Change Orders (\"PERMITTED Components\"), as detailed                hereunder. It is clarified that any Forecast updated following                the purchase of Permitted Components will not affect their                definition as Permitted Components, and NICE' obligations with                respect thereto, subject to the Liability.\n\n               3.4(A) PURCHASE OF INVENTORY BY NICE.\n\n                                       16\n\n                    NICE will purchase from Contractor inventory of Permitted                     Components not required (in whole or in part) according to                     the Forecast for the Quarter immediately following the time                     at which such inventory is reviewed as detailed below                     (hereinafter: the \"FIRST QUARTER\") as detailed below. The                     following terms shall have the definitions ascribed thereto:\n\n                    (i)  DEAD INVENTORY - Permitted Components, the entire                          quantity of which is not required for assembly of                          Products in accordance with the Forecast.\n\n                    (ii) SLOW MOVING INVENTORY - Permitted Components, which are                          required for assembly of Products for the two                          consecutive Quarters commencing immediately after the                          First Quarter, in accordance with the Forecast.\n\n                    (iii) EXCESS INVENTORY - Permitted Components, which are                          required for assembly of Products only during the third                          Quarter after the First Quarter or thereafter, in                          accordance with the Forecast.\n\n                    Three (3) days before the beginning of every Quarter,                     Contractor will issue a report of Dead, Slow Moving and                     Excess Inventory, and shall detail the price of each                     Permitted Component included in the report as specified in                     APPENDIX C, which report will need to be verified by NICE                     within 2-3 days. Inthe event that in any Quarter, the Dead                     Inventory, Excess Inventory and Slow Moving Inventory                     together exceed 15% of the Monthly Consideration (as defined                     below), NICE will purchase such inventory exceeding 15% from                     Contractor one day before the beginning of the First                     Quarter, by payment of the price detailed in APPENDIX C\n\n\n\n\n\n                    including a surcharge of 4%. In calculating and determining                     the inventory falling within the said 15% (which shall not                     be purchased by NICE) the following priority shall apply:                     first - all Slow Moving Inventory, second (if not all 15%                     were covered) - all Excess Inventory, third (if not all 15%                     were covered) - Dead Inventory. The \"MONTHLY CONSIDERATION\"                     for the purpose hereof shall mean the total actual price due                     to Contractor from NICE hereunder for all Products during                     the preceding Quarter, divided by three (3).\n\n                    The foregoing shall apply only as of Q3 2002 - July 1st 2002                     (the first report of inventory as above shall be issued at                     the end of June 2002), and thereafter on a regular basis.\n\n                    In the event NICE has purchased any Permitted Component from                     Contractor as detailed above, Contractor is obligated to                     repurchase such Permitted Component for production of the                     next Forecast which requires such Permitted Component in                     accordance with the relevant procedure of Section 2.7 above                     (Nice Existing Inventory), at the price sold to NICE by                     Contractor excluding the surcharge of 4%.\n\n               No other compensation or components protection will be provided                by NICE except as explicitly detailed above or in Sections 16.7,                16.8 and 17.5 of this Agreement. Upon\n\n                                       17\n\n               payment of the aforementioned compensation for Permitted                Components, such items shall become the property of NICE, and                will be promptly delivered to NICE' facility in Israel, and, at                NICE' election and expense, shall be delivered to another                location in Israel identified to Contractor by NICE or, at NICE'                direction, disposed of by Contractor (in any manner selected by                Contractor). In any event, Contractor will make best reasonable                commercial efforts to decrease levels of inventory of Permitted                Components, by agreeing with its suppliers to decrease Purchase                Lead Times to 1 - 2 weeks at the most.\n\n          3.5. CHANGE ORDERS. Throughout all the assembly phases of a Product                during the Production Lead Time and any time before the Due Date,                NICE may issue Contractor with a Change Order. The issuance of                such Change Order and the execution by Contractor of such Change                Order, shall be in accordance with the provisions hereunder. Upon                issuance of a Change Order, Contractor will immediately execute                it and the Product price shall change in accordance with APPENDIX                C. The sole implication of a Change Order will be payment for                additional direct labor costs as detailed in APPENDIX C. Replaced                components and sub-assemblies will be returned to Contractor's                inventory at no charge to NICE (without derogating from the                specific provisions of this Agreement under which NICE is                obligated to purchase Permitted Components). The Product price                will be as after the implementation of the Change Order. For                Change Orders issued prior to commencement of the Production Lead                Time for any Product no charge will be incurred by NICE. Without                derogating from the aforementioned, Contractor will not charge                NICE for Change Orders during the first three (3) months of                production.\n\n          3.6. RESCHEDULING OF RELEASED ORDERS. NICE may, at its discretion,                reschedule delivery of units of Products for which a PO has                already been issued, by shortening the Due Date, without any                implication. In this respect, Contractor is aware that by the                last three weeks of every calendar Quarter, a high level of                flexibility is required to meet NICE' end of Quarter                requirements. Contractor will perform its best reasonable                commercial efforts to complete such rescheduled Products at the                new requested Due Date. All such rescheduling shall be performed                by sending Contractor a written request for rescheduling.\n\n          3.7. ORDERS ON HOLD. Prior to the Due Date, NICE may, at its                discretion, place Products manufactured according to PO's on hold                for a period not to exceed thirty (30) Days from the Due Date,                without any implications, by giving a written notice to                Contractor. Upon termination of such 30 Day period or earlier if                requested by NICE in writing, the Products on hold will be deemed                as cancelled and the provisions of Section 3.8 below shall apply.\n\n          3.8. CANCELLATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS. NICE may at its discretion, at                any time, cancel, in whole or in part, PO's of Products issued\n\n                                       18\n\n               pursuant to this Agreement subject to the delivery of prior                written notice, before the respective Due Date. Contractor, upon                receipt of such written notice of cancellation, shall stop work                on such units of Products if work has already commenced. Without                derogating from any liability to pay for Permitted Components as                set forth elsewhere in specific provisions this Agreement, NICE                shall have no liability for cancellation of a PO prior to the                Production Lead Time of the Product. For cancellation of a PO                during the Production Lead Time and until the Due Date, NICE'                liability for cancellation shall be limited to the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n               3.8.1. Payment of a fixed cancellation charge for all cancelled                     units of Products as specified in APPENDIX C. The fixed                     cancellation charge will be recalculated at the end of the                     first Quarter, based on the actual average time to                     disassemble a Product, as determined by Contractor and                     agreed to by NICE;\n\n               3.8.2. All the components/sub-assemblies will be returned to                     Contractor's inventory at no charge to NICE subject to and                     in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n               3.8.3. NICE shall not be responsible and shall not pay, in whole                     or in part, for Products manufactured outside the agreed                     Production Lead Time and/or without a written NICE Purchase                     Order.\n\n          3.9. Contractor shall use its best reasonable commercial efforts to                minimize Change Order charges and cancellation charges by                returning components for credit (with NICE' approval), canceling                components on order and applying components to other Contractor                projects (when possible, at the sole discretion of Contractor)                and minimizing all work-in-process.\n\n          3.10. ENGINEERING CHANGE REQUESTS (ECR'S). NICE shall be entitled, at                its sole discretion, from time to time to request any Engineering                Change Requests for any Product and Contractor is obligated to                propose ECR's to NICE when applicable at Contractor's opinion.                Contractor will respond to all Engineering Change Requests                initiated by NICE, according to the terms hereof. Contractor will                give NICE written notice, within three (3) Business Days of                receiving written notice of such ECR, of the date by which, and                at what cost, such ECR could be implemented based on the pricing                formula in APPENDIX C, and how the ECR effects existing PO's.                Contractor will charge NICE for ECR's in accordance with APPENDIX                C (an administrative cost of $25 per ECR of whatever size).\n\n          3.11. ENGINEERING CHANGE ORDERS (ECO'S). NICE may, at its discretion,                issue ECO's based on Contractor's response to the ECR's or based                on negotiated changes to Contractor's response. The                administrative cost for an ECO shall be $50 per ECO. Engineering                Change Orders effective dates (the date for completion of                implementation\n\n                                       19\n\n               of the ECO) shall be as agreed to by the parties and shall effect                the relevant Lead Times and dates accordingly, as detailed in the                ECO. Contractor shall approve every ECO issued as above within 2                Business Days. An ECO shall become binding on Contractor upon                written confirmation of receipt thereby. Contractor shall not                make any design changes or any other changes in the Products                without the prior written consent of NICE as reflected in an ECO.                The new Product price due to an Engineering Change Order, shall                be determined in accordance with APPENDIX C. Contractor shall                make all reasonable commercial efforts to minimize costs due to                ECO's. Notwithstanding the aforementioned in Sections 3.10. and                3.11., NICE shall not be charged for the first $1,000 due to                Contractor in any one month for ECR's and ECO's.\n\n          3.12. DISASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS. From time to time, NICE may order                Contractor to disassemble Products after the Due Date. Upon such                request issued to Contractor, it shall promptly comply with the                request. Dismantled components will be consigned to Contractor's                inventory and stored in a special warehouse at Contractor's                facility, at no charge to NICE (the \"RETURNED COMPONENTS\"). NICE                will pay Contractor the original Product price and also a fixed                fee for dismantling as detailed in APPENDIX C. Thereafter,                Contractor will use the Returned Components first in the assembly                of any Products until no inventory of Returned Components                remains. Contractor will not charge NICE for any surcharge or                overhead for use of Returned Components in a Product.\n\n          3.13. SPARE PART MECHANISM. In addition to producing Products                hereunder, and in addition to Contractor's responsibilities under                its warranty obligation hereunder which are included in the                Product price as provided herein, Contractor will supply Spare                Parts to Customers upon request, as detailed in APPENDIX I                according to the applicable Production Lead Time. The price for                spare parts shall be in accordance with APPENDIX C and shall be                paid by NICE in accordance herewith.\n\n     4.   SCOPE; NEW PRODUCTS\n\n          4.1. The scope of this Agreement refers to the Products currently                detailed in APPENDIX A subject to the provisions of APPENDIX K.                The Manufacturing Outsourcing Services will be performed by                Contractor on a gradual basis as detailed hereinabove, and until                full performance of the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services by                Contractor for all Products.\n\n          4.2. Quotations by Contractor for new Products will be developed by                NICE in coordination with Contractor subject to the mutually                agreed upon pricing model set forth in APPENDIX C hereto. Other                terms applicable to new Products shall be identical to those                applicable to the current Products. Each such quotation requested\n\n\n\n\n\n               by NICE shall be provided to NICE on an expeditious basis.                Contractor shall develop a mutually agreeable quality program for                each new Product. The provisions of APPENDIX K - NICE Systems                Products Release Policy will apply to such new Products subject                to the terms hereof.\n\n5.   DUE DATE\n\n                                       20\n\n          5.1. Contractor shall target 100% on time delivery in compliance with                the Due Date. Contractor's performance regarding the Due Date                shall constitute a material obligation, and is an essential                element in this Agreement.\n\n          5.2. DELAYS.

Contractor shall at once, exercise its best reasonable                commercial measures to minimize the possible delay, at no                additional cost to NICE. Such measures may include, inter alia,                acceleration of payments to Contractor's vendors if necessary.\n\n          5.3. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. Any delay from the Due Date of a certain                Product in a certain Quarter, not due to a specific written                request by NICE or otherwise deriving from a breach of NICE'                undertakings hereunder and only to the extent deriving from such                breach by NICE, or caused by an event of Force Majeure, and                subject to the terms hereof, shall be considered a material                breach of Contractor's obligations under this Agreement and shall                entitle NICE to the following liquidated damages in addition to                any remedy available to NICE under this Agreement or by law:\n\n               5.3.1.

For the removal of doubt, when determining the liquidated                     damages due, the applicable sub-section 5.3.1, 5.3.2 OR                     5.3.3 will apply. In any event, the total liquidated damages                     as per this Section shall not exceed 5% of the Product                     Price.\n\n               5.3.5 The \"PRODUCT PRICE\" for the purpose of this Section 5.3.                     shall mean the total consideration which is due to                     Contractor for the Products being delayed at the relevant                     time.\n\n               5.3.6. In the event that following the delay, Contractor is in                     compliance with the Due Dates for two immediately                     consecutive Quarters and there is no delay whatsoever,                     Contractor will be reimbursed by NICE for liquidated damages                     already paid for delay in the previous Quarter (before the                     said 2 Quarters), if paid, without derogating from the                     previous delay being regarded as a breach hereunder.\n\n               5.3.7 NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR DUE DATE. Notwithstanding the                     aforementioned, Contractor shall be relived from its                     responsibility for the Due Date of any specific Product if                     all the following terms are met:\n\n                    (1)  Contractor notifies Nice promptly in writing of the                          delay and the detailed reasons for the delay;\n\n                    (2)  Contractor proves that such delay was caused by a                          worldwide event of component allocation or a worldwide                          event of Force Majeure (as defined in this Agreement)                          applying to a manufacturer of necessary components                          required for assembly of the Product and such                          components can not be purchased from another                          manufacturer, since the manufacturer with which                          Contractor has contracted (directly or through                          suppliers) is a single source manufacturer worldwide                          or, if there is more than one source - the above                          applies to all of them;\n\n                                       21\n\n                    (3)  Contractor proves, that it has employed all necessary                          measures, both upon contracting with the supplier                          (including but not limited to - contracting other                          suppliers) and after becoming aware of the delay, in                          order to ensure proper timely delivery by such supplier                          and in accordance with the agreed Purchase Lead Time in                          this Agreement;\n\n                    (4)  Contractor takes all required actions in order to                          minimize the effects of such occurrence and solve it.\n\n6.   SHIPMENT DATE, PACKING AND SHIPPING\n\n\n\n\n\n          6.1. PACKING. Contractor shall package each unit of Product according                to the standard NICE packing procedure and specifications in                accordance with the PDM System, or, if not specified by NICE,                according to good commercial standards. Every shipment to a NICE                Customer must include a Packing List issued by the Contractor,                attached to the packed Product. The Packing List is derived from                the Purchase Order and includes all the packed items in the                carton and all software licenses associated with the Product.\n\n          6.2. PREPARATION OF EXPORT SHIPMENTS. Contractor will be responsible                for preparing the shipment of the final Product to the Customer                by arranging the pallets and packing them according to NICE'                instructions as set forth in the PDM System.\n\n          6.3. DELIVERY. Unless agreed otherwise in the future, Contractor will                deliver finished Products to NICE' designated freight forwarder,                at Contractor's premises.\n\n          6.4. SHIPMENT DATES. The following Shipment dates shall apply:                Shipment plans that Contractor receives until 13:00, will be                ready until the end of the same Day (except that on weekend days                prior coordination will be required); Shipment plans that                Contractor receives after 13:00, will be ready until the end of                the next Day (except that on weekend days prior coordination will                be required).\n\n               Contractor's performance regarding the Shipment Date shall                constitute a material obligation, and is an essential element in                this Agreement.\n\n          6.5. INSPECTION. Products will be subject to inspection by NICE, or by                certified NICE' distributors according to the following                provisions, both prior to the Shipment Date while they are in the                finished goods warehouse and after the Shipment Date. During the                inspection, NICE may open cartons and boxes and unpack the                contents for inspection. An inspection will be coordinated if                possible. NICE may inform the Contractor if there is any mismatch                in Product quantities or if any damage was caused to the shipment                prior to delivery to NICE' freight forwarder in Contractor's                facility. In case of a quantity mismatch between the quantity                recorded on the packing documents and the actual quantity                received, NICE will notify Contractor\n\n                                       22\n\n               of the mismatch, and, subject to verification by Contractor,                Contractor will complete the missing quantity. In case where a                shipment is found damaged prior to delivery to NICE' freight                forwarder at Contractor's facility, the Contractor will replace                or repair the Product and deliver it back to such NICE' freight                forwarder at Contractor's facility, at Contractor's expense. If                there was no mismatch in quantities or no damage to the shipment                (as applicable), NICE will bear all risk and costs associated                with the delivery of shipment to Contractor and back.\n\n7.   [DELETED]\n\n8.   PAYMENTS\n\n          8.1. Initial prices as proposed in the Proposal are set out in                APPENDIX C. Within one month from signature of this Agreement,                the parties will amend the initial APPENDIX C according to                components purchase prices and supplier agreements obtained by                Contractor, but in no event will the relevant data exceed the                data included in the initial APPENDIX C, except with respect to                components sold to Contractor by NICE according to APPENDIX F and                Section 2.7, or further to changes in APPENDIX C made pursuant to                NICE' instructions under Sections 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4 of this                Agreement. Contractor will use reasonable commercial efforts to                improve the particulars in APPENDIX C and, amongst others,                shorten Liability. In the event of lack of agreement on the                amended APPENDIX C within one month from the signature date, the                initial Appendix C shall continue to apply until agreed                otherwise. It is clarified that labor prices in APPENDIX C will                not be amended as aforementioned regarding components. Contractor                hereby declares and undertakes that the details included in                APPENDIX C(as amended from time to time according to the                provisions of this Agreement) shall be the accurate details from                all of the relevant purchase agreements of Contractor with its                suppliers and components and sub assembly prices in APPENDIX C                shall be net purchase prices by Contractor without any overhead                or uplift. Thereafter, prices may be decreased or increased                according to the formula and at the timetables detailed herein                below.\n\n          8.2. COST ADJUSTMENTS. Product pricing shall remain firm for Products                for each Quarter, except as follows or as set forth in Sections,                2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.5, 3.8, 3.11, 8.1, 8.3, and hereunder in the                various subsections of Section 8.2:\n\n               8.2.1. The quoted cost of all components and sub-assemblies in                     each Product subject to this Agreement is or will be set                     forth in APPENDIX C or an agreed written amendment thereto.\n\n               8.2.2. NICE and Contractor shall continually work to introduce\n\n\n\n\n\n                    new cost reduction methods.\n\n                                       23\n\n                    Contractor shall make its best reasonable commercial efforts                     to reduce the cost of manufacturing Products, by methods                     such as elimination of components, obtaining alternate                     sources of materials, redefinition of specifications, and                     improved assembly or test methods, subject to NICE' written                     approval. Upon implementation of such methods initiated by                     Contractor, Contractor will enjoy one hundred percent (100%)                     of the cost reduction during the first Quarter and                     thereafter will reduce the price accordingly so that NICE                     will enjoy one hundred percent (100%) of the cost reduction.                     NICE will immediately enjoy one hundred percent (100%) of                     the cost reduction upon implementation of such methods                     initiated by NICE.\n\n               8.2.3. In the event there is a decrease in the cost of a                     component or sub-assembly purchased by Contractor for the                     purposes hereof, which affects the purchase price of such                     Product, Contractor shall document such decrease in costs                     and provide such information to NICE in writing, in                     reasonable detail, within three (3) Business Days of                     Contractor becoming aware of such decrease.\n\n               8.2.4. In case of a decrease as aforementioned, the purchase                     prices in APPENDIX C for units of the affected Product shall                     be adjusted accordingly.\n\n               8.2.5. In the event there is an increase in the cost of a                     Permitted Component purchased/to be purchased by Contractor                     for the purposes hereof, which affects the purchase price of                     such Product, Contractor shall provide NICE with copies of                     letters as elaborated below, together with a request for a                     \"price increase\" within one (1) Business Days of Contractor                     becoming aware of such increase. Contractor shall not                     purchase any such component until NICE approves it in                     writing. NICE shall approve/disapprove on the same Business                     Day it was notified by Contractor provided notice was                     received by 12:00. However, NICE may only reject a price                     increase if it can show that the Permitted Component is                     available at the a lower price. There are two permitted                     types of price increases:\n\n                    (i)  TEMPORARY PRICE INCREASE designated to meet the                          requested Due Date, in the event of receiving a                          Purchase Order/Forecast for which the Purchase Lead                          Time is shorter than the normal Purchase Lead Time of                          the relevant components detailed in APPENDIX C or due                          to an Engineering Change Order which affects the Due                          Date. Contractor shall provide NICE with copies of                          letters of approach to at least 3 suppliers that are                          known in the market and accepted commonly (if 3                          suppliers exist for such component) and their response.                          In such event, NICE will pay Contractor the difference                          between the original price and the actual price for                          those components purchased after the increase.\n\n                                       24\n\n                    (ii) CONSTANT PRICE INCREASE caused by a change in the                          market trend. Market trend increase requests will be                          explained by providing NICE with copies of letters of                          approach to at least 3 suppliers that are known in the                          market and accepted commonly (if 3 suppliers exist),                          and their response. NICE will pay Contractor the                          difference between the original price and the actual                          price for those components purchased after the increase                          within the Quarter, and thereafter APPENDIX C shall be                          updated accordingly.\n\n          8.3. COST REVIEW. During each calendar Quarter, no later than the                third week of the Quarter, the parties will jointly review the                costs, costs reduction, volume performance of Contractor and                NICE, respectively, and other performance parameters to be                mutually agreed upon by the parties. The pricing and other                details referenced in APPENDIX C shall be jointly reviewed by the                parties at an agreed upon frequency and may be modified with the                mutual written agreement of the parties.\n\n          8.4.

Contractor hereby warrants to NICE that it has the full corporate                power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform                its obligations hereunder; that no impediment exists to                Contractor entering into this Agreement, and no other agreement                has been or will be made with any third party which will have a                detrimental effect on Contractor's ability to fulfill its                obligations under this Agreement.\n\n          9.2. Contractor hereby warrants to NICE that it has ascertained the                nature of the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services and its own                ability to perform such Manufacturing Outsourcing Services, and                that all Manufacturing Outsourcing Services provided by                Contractor hereunder will be performed in a professional and                workmanlike manner by a sufficient number of individuals with                appropriate skills and training for the applicable task using                systems and processes which are sufficient to accomplish the                Contractor performance\n\n                                       26\n\n               obligations under this Agreement. In addition, without derogating                from any undertaking, warranty or representation of NICE included                in the Agreement, Contractor acknowledges and agrees that prior                to the entering into this Agreement it has had the ability to                perform a due diligence investigation into the manufacturing,                production, testing and delivery as performed by NICE up to and                including the date hereof, that it has in fact performed such an                investigation and that based upon the outcome thereof, it                believes that it has the professional and other capabilities to                perform the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services as set forth                herein in a professional and workmanlike manner.\n\n          9.3. Contractor further warrants that it is duly licensed, authorized,                or qualified to do business and in good standing in every                jurisdiction in which a license, authorization, or qualification                is required for the ownership or leasing of its assets, of the                transactions of business of the character transacted by it except                where the failure to be so licensed, authorized, or qualified                would not have a material adverse effect on Contractor's ability                to fulfill is obligations under this Agreement.\n\n          9.4. PRODUCT WARRANTY. Contractor warrants to NICE that each of the                Products manufactured, configured or tested by Contractor will                have been manufactured, configured and tested in conformance with                the Specifications therefor as provided by NICE and be free from                defects in workmanship or material for the Warranty Period. It is\n\n\n\n\n\n               clarified for the avoidance of doubt, that the aforesaid warranty                of Contractor for the Products applies to the entire Product,                including components and workmanship, except when the defect or                malfunction results from the design, NICE Software or the Nice                Components supplied by NICE under this Agreement if Contractor                cannot obtain warranty service for same from the supplier (and                Contractor shall notify NICE accordingly), for which NICE shall                be responsible.\n\n          9.5. Contractor shall be responsible for procurement of components as                set forth herein, inspection of components, and safe handling of                the components while in-house at Contractor's premises.\n\n          9.6. RMA. Should a Product fail to be in conformity with the above                warranties during the Warranty Period, NICE shall deliver the                Product to Contractor at its expense, Contractor shall repair or                replace the Product at no charge (as set forth in Section 9.7                below), and will cover all shipment and delivery costs of                therepaired or replaced Product from Contractor's facility to                NICE' Customer location (whether in Israel or abroad). In the                case that the determination according to Section 9.9 below, is                that Contractor's warranty hereunder does not apply, NICE will                bare all shipment and delivery costs of the Product/s and their                return, and of any repair/replacement costs if requested by NICE,                according to APPENDIX C. Detailed procedures to be executed by                Contractor concerning the repair of defective/malfunctioning                Products subject to the warranty hereunder are included in                APPENDIX N - Return Material Authorization (\"RMA\").\n\n                                       27\n\n          9.7. WARRANTY SERVICE. Contractor shall replace any such Product with                a new Product except when the defect is in the NICE proprietary                boards, in which case Contractor may repair the Product.                Contractor will deliver the repaired or replacement unit to NICE,                within seven (7) Days of Contractor's receipt of such Product or                parts thereof. NICE may require a shorter repair and replacement                time for up to ten percent (10%) of the returned Products for                warranty service, and Contractor shall use its best reasonable                commercial efforts to accommodate same.\n\n               NICE shall provide Contractor a spares forecast for warranty                requirements for the period up and until July 1, 2002. If during                such period, the spare parts required for warranty service alone                exceed the spares forecast provided by NICE, NICE shall sell                Contractor the missing spares at the prices specified in APPENDIX                C. Nevertheless, NICE shall have no liability in the event the                spares forecast exceeds the actual spares used during that                period. As of July 1, 2002 purchasing of spares in order to                comply with the warranty obligations shall be the sole                responsibility of Contractor and no forecast shall be provided.\n\n               On or about July 1, 2002 the parties will review the said 7 days                timetable, and any changes in such timetable shall need to be                agreed in advance in writing, both Parties acting reasonably and                in good faith. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall obligate                NICE to change such warranty timetable since its Customer                obligations are dependent on it.\n\n               The units of Products for which action may be required under this                warranty shall be returned to Contractor's manufacturing                facility, at NICE' expense, with an accompanying Contractor                supplied RMA and correction / replacement time shall commence                upon return of the defective Product to Contractor's facility.                The RMA will include a packing slip only and will not include an                invoice.\n\n          9.8. ADVANCED RMA. From time to time, NICE may request that the                Contractor supply RMA to NICE Customers prior to receipt by                Contractor of the failed Products. In such event, replacement                time shall be 7 Days of receipt of the RMA and NICE will be                responsible for the return of the failed Product or parts                thereof, respectively, to the Contractor within sixty (60) Days                from the delivery of the said RMA. If the failed Product is not                returned within same period, Contractor shall invoice NICE for                the replaced Product supplied.\n\n          9.9. DETERMINING DEFECT SOURCE. NICE and Contractor will use their                best commercial efforts to determine whether a defect in a unit                of Product exists and the reason for such defect. In the event of                dispute\n\n                                       28\n\n               whether the source of a defect is subject to Contractor's                warranty as detailed in Section 9.4, the parties will assign a                joint MRB (Material Review Board) team to determine the source of                defect, whose decisions must be mutually agreed to by both                parties. NICE shall perform any investigation/examination                reasonably requested by Contractor. In the event that the joint                MRB team can not reach a mutually agreed decision, Contractor                shall be deemed responsible for the warranty repair or                replacement, unless Contractor proves otherwise, and NICE shall                supply Contractor with all necessary information to assist in\n\n\n\n\n\n               such determination. It is clarified that in the event of a                dispute as aforementioned regarding the source of a defect,                Contractor shall, nevertheless, continue its warranty obligations                in a timely manner and will not withhold delivery of repaired and                replaced Products, but may demand further investigation by the                MRB team as above.\n\n          9.10. WARRANTIES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES. If and to the extent                warranties provided by third parties for components or                sub-assemblies (forming an integral part of the defective Product                sold to NICE hereunder) that Contractor/anyone on its behalf                purchases under this Agreement, exceed the Warranty Period                hereunder, Contractor shall ensure that NICE will benefit from                such warranties included in agreements with suppliers as detailed                in Section 2.2 above and use its best reasonable commercial                efforts so that NICE may benefit from such warranties included in                agreements with suppliers as detailed in Section 2 above, at                Contractors' expense. Contractor will cooperate with NICE in its                efforts to exercise its rights under such warranties for their                entire duration. The aforementioned shall apply both during and                after the term of this Agreement.\n\n          9.11 POST-WARRANTY RMA. Contractor shall provide post-Warranty RMA                services to NICE in accordance with the procedures in APPENDIX N                and the prices in APPENDIX C.\n\n9A.  NICE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\n\n     9A.1. NICE hereby warrants to Contractor that it has the full corporate           power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its           obligations hereunder; that no impediment exists to NICE entering into           this Agreement, and no other agreement has been or will be made with           any third party which will have a detrimental effect on NICE' ability           to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n     9A.2 NICE hereby warrants to Contractor that it has the financial ability           to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n                                       29\n\n10.  AUDIT AND ACCESS\n\n     10.1. REPORTS. Contractor shall provide to NICE periodical reports in the           format acceptable by NICE and agreed by Contractor, which shall be           submitted each week, unless agreed otherwise in writing. In addition,           NICE may request other reports pertaining to the Outsourcing           Manufacturing Services and Contractor will promptly comply with such           requests, to the extent reasonable.\n\n     10.2. GENERAL. NICE shall have the rights to conduct audits of the           Manufacturing Outsourcing Services and related facilities, systems,           and records as set forth in this Section 10 for the purpose of           auditing Contractor's compliance with the provisions of this           Agreement, all subject to the limitations below. The audits shall           include the physical equipment designated for the Manufacturing           Outsourcing Services provided hereunder, the facility at Contractors'           premises designated for the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services           including the finished goods warehouse, the inventory designated for           the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services provided hereunder and any           records, supporting documentation, equipment and information           pertaining solely to NICE and this Agreement, provided that with           regard to records pertaining to inventory/components, in addition to           the particulars detailed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, NICE will have           access to the ERP system at Contractor's facility only (including for           the avoidance of doubt, the modules of the ERP system dealing with           invoices and invoicing). No documents or data of any kind, or any           copies, may be removed from Contractor's facility and all audits shall           be performed within such facility only.\n\n     10.3. Such audits are expected to occur frequently given the significant           security and business practices concerns inherent in the Manufacturing           Outsourcing Services and NICE shall have the sole discretion, not to           be unreasonably applied, to determine the frequency. NICE agrees to           conduct the audits in a reasonable manner so as not to cause undue           disruption to Contractor's provision of the Manufacturing Outsourcing           Services and such audits shall be conducted during business hours, and           shall be coordinated with Contractor. In the course of such audits           Contractor shall provide, and shall cause its Permitted Subcontractors           to provide, such auditors any reasonable assistance that they may           require. Such reasonable assistance shall be provided as part of the           Manufacturing Outsourcing Services.\n\n     10.4. If any audit by an auditor designated by NICE results in Contractor           being notified that it or its Permitted Subcontractors are not in           compliance with any law or regulation, Contractor shall, and shall           cause its Permitted Subcontractors to, take actions to comply with           such law or regulation, at Contractor's or its Permitted           Subcontractor's expense.\n\n                                       30\n\n     10.5. RESULTS OF AUDITS. If, as a result of an audit, NICE determines that           Contractor has undercharged or overcharged NICE, NICE shall notify           Contractor in writing of the amount of such undercharge or overcharge,\n\n\n\n\n\n          and shall specify the relevant data and the reasoning for its           determination. If Contractor agrees in writing, an appropriate           adjustment shall promptly be paid to NICE or Contractor. In the event           Contractor believes that it has complied with the relevant law,           regulation or this Agreement, and has not overcharged or undercharged           NICE, it shall so notify NICE in writing upon receipt of NICE' audit           results shall specify the relevant data and the reasoning for its           determination and the parties will attempt to determine the issue in           mutual consent.\n\n     10.6. CONTRACTOR RECORD RETENTION AND ACCESS. As part of the Manufacturing           Outsourcing Services, Contractor shall (1) retain records and           supporting documentation detailed in Section 10.2 above if and to the           extent such record retention is required by tax or similar           authorities, and/or exists in the ERP system, and/or is common           practice in the industry, including but not limited to - production           files for the following periods: 7 years for records required by tax           or similar authorities and ERP data, 3 years for production files,           otherwise as required by law or as is the common practice, and (2)           upon notice of no less than five (5) Days from NICE, provide NICE and           its designees with reasonable access to such records and documentation           for the purpose of conducting NICE' business and reporting. Such           access shall only be provided to audit personnel who have signed           towards Contractor a non-disclosure undertaking incorporating terms           which are substantially the same as those in APPENDIX E.\n\n     10.7 All audits of all kind by NICE shall be subject to the confidentiality           obligations of NICE to Contractor detailed in this Agreement.\n\n11.  SAFETY AND SECURITY, FACILITIES, NON-GENERIC EQUIPMENT\n\n     11.1. SAFETY AND SECURITY.

APPROVAL OF LOCATION. NICE shall have the right to approve or           disqualify each location at which Contractor is providing any of its           services hereunder. Contractor agrees that the Manufacturing           Outsourcing Services will be performed in a dedicated space in           Contractor's facility in which no production of competing products           will be conducted. Access to the NICE production lines will be limited           only to Contractor's employees performing the Manufacturing           Outsourcing Services and NICE representatives.\n\n     11.5. NON GENERIC EQUIPMENT. During the term of this Agreement, the Non           Generic Equipment shall be furnished to Contractor (without charge)           and used in Contractor's premises for purposes of performing its           various obligations under this Agreement, according to the terms           hereof. Such Non Generic Equipment shall:\n\n          (1)  Be clearly marked and identified as NICE' property.\n\n          (2)  Be safely stored, adequately maintained and insured against loss                or damage under Contractor's existing policies detailed in                APPENDIX D. In the event such Non Generic Equipment is damaged,                lost or destroyed, Contractor shall be liable towards NICE to                repair or replace such equipment (at Contractor's choice).\n\n          (3)  Remain the sole property of NICE, and therefore shall be kept                free of liens and encumbrances imposed on Contractor's property.\n\n          (4)  Be returned to NICE upon request, or upon termination of this                Agreement, at the same condition as originally furnished to                Contractor except for normal wear and tear. Notwithstanding                anything to contrary, if NICE requests to have the Non Generic                Equipment returned thereto prior to the termination of the                relevant services hereunder, Contractor shall have no liability                or obligation for the performance of any obligations hereunder                for which such Non Generic Equipment is reasonably required.                Contractor shall notify NICE in writing in detail of the                aforementioned, promptly upon NICE' request to receive the Non                Generic Equipment.\n\n          (5)  Be used according to NICE' written instructions and information                concerning such Non Generic Equipment.\n\n          (6)  Shall not be used by Contractor for any other purpose except for                NICE' needs and shall be dedicated for performance of this                Agreement.\n\n          (7)  Nevertheless, NICE may request Contractor to purchase some Non                Generic Equipment by itself and in such event Contractor shall\n\n\n\n\n\n               invoice NICE for the purchase price. Such equipment shall be                deemed for all purposes as part of the \"Non Generic Equipment\"                and shall be sold to NICE upon termination of this Agreement for                any reason, at a total sale price of 1$.\n\n                                       32\n\n12.

Contractor shall use the same           degree of care with respect to NICE Proprietary Information as it uses           in protecting its own proprietary information and trade secrets.\n\n          Without derogating from the aforementioned, Contractor shall not, in           any way or manner, directly or indirectly, engineer, reverse engineer,           compile, decompile or reverse assemble the NICE Software, or analyze           or otherwise examine the NICE Software for the purpose of reverse           engineering.\n\n     12.3. In addition, Contractor shall not disclose the NICE Proprietary           Information to any Personnel, except on a need to know basis as           required in order to implement this Agreement. Contractor undertakes           to procure that its Personnel and Permitted Subcontractors engaged in           performance of this Agreement (except subcontractor's employees who do           not have access to the NICE production lines at Contractor's           premises), and reasonably designated by NICE in advance in writing,           have signed a non-disclosure agreement in the form of APPENDIX E,           prior to receipt of any NICE Proprietary Information.\n\n                                       33\n\n          12.3A Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Contractor shall have                no liability with respect to disclosure of NICE Proprietary                Information if such information came into the possession of the                Contractor independently of this Agreement, through a breach of                obligation of secrecy of a third party to NICE, of which                Contractor was not aware and should not have been aware if                Contractor had exercised due care.\n\n     12.4. CONFIDENTIALITY BY NICE. NICE shall not: transfer to others, copy or           duplicate, sub-license sell, publish, display or otherwise make           available in any form or disclose, the Contractor's Proprietary           Information, to any third party, except for the purpose of performing           this Agreement. NICE shall use the same degree of care with respect to           such Contractor's Proprietary Information as it uses in protecting its           own proprietary information and trade secrets. All rights in           Contractor's Proprietary Information, shall remain solely with           Contractor. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, it is agreed that any           manufacturing methods applied by Contractor, which are Contractor's           Proprietary Information, may be used by NICE itself (including its           Affiliates) (but may not be transferred/disclosed to any third party)           and by signing this Agreement Contractor hereby grants NICE a           personal, non exclusive, non transferable, perpetual license to use           such manufacturing methods.\n\n          12.4A Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, NICE shall have no                liability with respect to disclosure of Contractor Proprietary                Information if such information came into the possession of NICE                independently of this Agreement, through a breach of obligation                of secrecy of a third party to Contractor, of which NICE was not                aware and should not have been aware if NICE had exercised due                care.\n\n     12.5. LEGAL OBLIGATION TO DISCLOSE. In the event a party is required to           disclose Proprietary Information of the other party, by applicable law\n\n\n\n\n\n          or by any government in the exercise of its lawful authority, the           party so required shall (i) promptly notify the other party in           writing, and, at the other party's expense: (ii) use reasonable and           lawful efforts to resist making any disclosure of Proprietary           Information not approved by the other party, (iii) use reasonable and           lawful efforts to limit the amount of Proprietary Information to be           disclosed pursuant to any such disclosure, and (iv) cooperate with the           other party to obtain a protective order or other appropriate relief           to minimize the further dissemination of any Proprietary Information           to be disclosed pursuant to any such disclosure.\n\n     12.6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION BY CONTRACTOR. Contractor shall           indemnify, hold harmless and defend NICE from and against any and all           damages (including all damages awarded to a third party and payable by           NICE), costs, losses, and expenses (including settlement awards and           reasonable attorney's fees) arising from any claim or suit made           against NICE or a third party which NICE is obligated to indemnify, by           a third party based on the allegation that the Products infringe or           violate any Intellectual Property right due to the components and/or           sub assemblies supplied by Contractor hereunder and/or the           manufacturing processes and methods as performed by Contractor           hereunder. Contractor shall include in all its agreements with           suppliers/ manufacturers provisions regarding Intellectual Property           indemnification substantially similar to those included in this           Agreement, providing inter alia that they are freely assignable to           NICE without any modification or consent.\n\n                                       34\n\n          Nevertheless, in the event NICE designates specific components to be           purchased by Contractor hereunder and the manufacturer/supplier of           such NICE designated components refuses to grant Contractor           indemnification for infringement of Intellectual Property rights,           despite Contractor performing its best reasonable commercial efforts           to obtain such indemnification (which Contractor shall prove to NICE           by submission of copies of its correspondence with the manufacturer           including the manufacturer's response), then if NICE approves purchase           of such components, Contractor shall not be responsible for           Intellectual Property indemnification due to those specific           components.\n\n          For the removal of doubt, Contractor shall not be liable for any           infringement of an Intellectual Property right due to any NICE           Proprietary Information, NICE Intellectual Property, NICE Software,           Non Generic Equipment (if used in accordance with the instructions           provided by NICE), and due to performance as is of NICE written           instructions including specifications and design.\n\n               Contractor's indemnification as provided under this Section shall                apply only if: Contractor is notified promptly in writing of any                notice of a claim or of a threatened or actual suit; and is given                control of the defense thereof and all related settlement                negotiations; and, NICE provides, at Contractor's request and                expense, all reasonable cooperation and assistance for the                defense and negotiations of the claim. Nevertheless, in the event                the claim or suit is based on the allegation that the Products                infringe or violate any Intellectual Property right due to the                components and/or sub assemblies supplied by Contractor hereunder                which were designated by Nice as aforementioned, and the supplier                / manufacturer of the infringing component has an indemnity                undertaking as above towards Contractor; (i) which is assignable                to NICE and Contractor promptly assigns to NICE such                indemnification undertaking from its supplier / manufacturer;                (ii) which is unassignable to NICE but Contractor notifies NICE                promptly in writing of any notice of the claim or of a threatened                or actual suit; and gives NICE on behalf of Contractor and NICE'                chosen counsel control of the defense thereof and all related                settlement negotiations; then in both such instances Contractor                shall not be responsible for Intellectual Property                indemnification with respect thereto. In all other events,                Contractor shall conduct the litigation as aforementioned.\n\n     12.7. Following establishment of infringement of Intellectual Property by a           competent authority including at interlocutory proceedings, whether           Contractor is responsible therefor or not, NICE may issue an ECR and           Contractor will handle such ECR and the corresponding ECO promptly in           accordance with Sections 3.10, 3.11.\n\n     12.8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION BY NICE. NICE shall indemnify,\n\n                                       35\n\n          hold harmless and defend Contractor from and against any and all           damages (including all damages awarded to a third party and payable by           Contractor), costs, losses, and expenses (including settlement awards           and reasonable attorney's fees) arising from or in connection with any           claim or suit made against Contractor or a third party which           Contractor is obligated to indemnify, by a third party based on an           allegation that the Products and/or the NICE Software infringe or           violate any Intellectual Property right, including due to the use of           any NICE Proprietary Information, NICE Intellectual Property, NICE           Software, Non Generic Equipment (if used in accordance with the           instructions provided by NICE), or due to performance as is of any           NICE written instructions including specifications and design, but\n\n\n\n\n\n          excluding any allegation that the Products infringe or violate any           Intellectual Property right due to the components and/or sub           assemblies supplied by Contractor hereunder and/or the manufacturing           processes and methods as performed by Contractor hereunder for which           Contractor is liable as per Section 12.6. above.\n\n          NICE' indemnification as provided under this Agreement shall apply           only if: NICE is notified promptly in writing of any notice of a claim           or of a threatened or actual suit; and is given control of the defense           thereof and all related settlement negotiations; and, Contractor           provides, at NICE' request and expense, all reasonable cooperation and           assistance for the defense and negotiations of the claim.\n\n     12.9. EMPLOYEE AND CONTRACTOR INDEMNIFICATION. Each of the parties agrees           that it will indemnify the other party against any and all claims           hereafter brought or asserted by any person against the other party           relating to any alleged or actual action or omission to act by the           indemnifying party arising from, or in connection with, such person's           status as an employee or independent Contractor of the indemnifying           person or the termination of such status.\n\n     12.10. PUBLICITY. Except with the express written consent of NICE,           Contractor shall not make any press announcement or publicize this           Agreement or any matters relating to any of the transactions           contemplated hereby or use NICE' name or trademark in any way           whatsoever, except to the extent required to comply with applicable           laws or governmental regulations, provided that Contractor acts           according to Section 12.5.\n\n13.  INSURANCE\n\n     13.1. Contractor shall be liable for the total or partial loss of or damage           to the components and/or the Products in so far as such loss or damage           has occurred while in Contractor's possession and until delivery of           the Products to NICE' freight forwarder at Contractor's facility.\n\n                                       36\n\n     13.2. Without limiting any of the obligations or liabilities of Contractor,           whether under this Agreement or by law, subject to any limitations           hereunder, Contractor shall maintain, and shall cause any           subcontractors engaged by Contractor to provide services under this           Agreement to maintain, at Contractor's own expense, as long as this           Agreement is in effect, insurance policies of the kind and limits as           set forth in APPENDIX D to this Agreement. The expense of such           insurance shall be borne by Contractor. The Contractor shall keep in           force the policies specified in sections 1 and 3 to the Insurance           Certificate valid as long as Contractor's legal liability EXISTS IN           CONNECTION WITH OPERATIONS ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT.\n\n          It is Contractor's responsibility to ensure that the insurance           requirements set forth in APPENDIX D to this Agreement remain in           effect for the term of this Agreement.\n\n     13.3. Within ten (10) Days of the execution of this Agreement, Contractor           shall furnish to NICE certificates of insurance evidencing full           compliance with the insurance requirements as set forth in APPENDIX D           to this Agreement. Certificates of Insurance shall be kept current           throughout the entire term of this Agreement.\n\n     13.4. The carrying of any insurance required hereunder shall not be           interpreted as relieving Contractor of any responsibility and/or           undertaking to NICE according to the provisions of this Agreement or           by law. Contractor shall give prompt notice of all losses or claims of           which Contractor has knowledge which may be in any way related to this           Agreement and Contractor shall assist and cooperate with any insurance           company in the adjustment or litigation of all claims arising under           this Agreement or by law and indemnifiable by Contractor under this           Agreement or by law.\n\n     13.5. NICE shall include in its property policies a waiver of subrogation           clause against the Contractor, its directors and any one on its           behalf, provided that such waiver will not be valid towards a person           which caused malicious damage.\n\n14.

Except as provided in Sections 15.2 and 15.3, any breach by any Party           of this Agreement which was not remedied within forty-five (45) Days           from the date of notice, shall be regarded as a fundamental breach.\n\n     15.2. Notwithstanding the aforementioned in Section 15.1, any delay in the           Due Date and/or Shipment Date, which was not remedied within thirty           (30) Days from the date of notice for the first delay, and any           subsequent delay upon notice (i.e. any second delay, even if the first           one was less then 30 days) shall be regarded as a fundamental breach.\n\n                                       37\n\n     15.3.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, Schedules, Exhibits and Appendices           constitute the entire agreement between the parties in connection with           its subject matter and supersede all prior communications and           agreements between the parties relating to its subject matter.           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no documents, procedures,           methods or policies shall bind the Parties unless they are in writing           and signed by both parties, except that all the technical           documentation included in the PDM System may be changed as provided in           Section A (xxxii). Any change in NICE' procedures or policies, shall           bind Contractor after it is notified of same, unless the change is           material, in which case Contractor can object to the change on           reasonable grounds detailed in writing.\n\n     17.2. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may only be amended, varied or modified by           the prior agreement in writing of NICE and Contractor. Any such           amendment, variation or modification shall be binding upon the parties           and upon their successors and assigns. Work procedures and technical           documents may be signed by any representative on behalf of each of the           parties and need not be signed by authorized signatories of the           parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n     17.3. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the           benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted           assigns. Neither party shall in any way sell, transfer, assign,           sub-contract or otherwise dispose of any of the rights, privileges,           duties and obligations granted or imposed upon it under this           Agreement. However, NICE may, at its discretion, transfer and/or           assign any of its rights, privileges, duties and obligations granted           or imposed upon it under this Agreement to any NICE Affiliate,           provided that NICE remains responsible towards Contractor, jointly and           severally with the Affiliate, for all of its obligations hereunder so           assigned, and provided further that the assignee signs this Agreement.\n\n                                       41\n\n          It is further clarified that NICE may choose, by written notice to           Contractor, to enable any NICE Affiliate to act on NICE' behalf and in           its name under this Agreement directly VIS-A-VIS Contractor, without           relieving NICE as the sole contractual party from responsibility for           performance of the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Upon           NICE' prior written approval and upon the terms and limitations of           such approval, Contractor may sub-contract some of its obligations           (\"PERMITTED SUBCONTRACTORS\"), provided, however, that Contractor shall           remain obligated under this Agreement. Contractor shall provide to           NICE material qualifications and identification details of such           Permitted Subcontractors. Contractor shall at all times remain fully           responsible for the performance of all obligations of Contractor           hereunder, jointly and severally with the Permitted Subcontractors. In           selecting subcontractors to assist Contractor in the performance of           this Agreement, Contractor shall comply with all reasonable NICE           vendor screening requirements which are provided to it, and Contractor           shall also comply with its own vendor screening requirements.\n\n     17.4. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid,           illegal or unenforceable for any reason by any court of competent           jurisdiction, such provision shall be separable from the remainder of           the provisions hereof which shall continue in full force and effect as           if this Agreement had been executed with the invalid provisions           eliminated.\n\n     17.5. FORCE MAJEURE.\n\n          17.5.1. Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay in                performance or failure to perform, in whole or in part, due to                war or act of war (whether an actual declaration is made or not),                riot, civil commotion, act of public enemy, fire, flood, or other                act of God, act of any governmental authority, or similar causes                beyond the reasonable control of such party which could not have                been foreseen or prevented. If any event of force majeure occurs,                the Party affected by such event shall promptly notify the other                Party of such event in writing and take all reasonable actions to                avoid the effect of such event.\n\n          17.5.2. Nevertheless, if any event of force majeure occurs for a                consecutive period of fourteen (14) Days preventing Contractor                from performing the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services, and                Contractor has not managed to set up the Manufacturing                Outsourcing Services at the Backup Site, NICE may, at its                discretion, elect to perform the Manufacturing Outsourcing                Services or any part thereof by itself and/or through others,                without derogating from its other rights and remedies, if                applicable. In such event: (a) Contractor shall assist NICE by                putting at its use, at NICE' request, Contractor Personnel who                are involved in the performance of this Agreement, to the extent                possible, at a charge to be agreed based on the labor rates in                APPENDIX C; (b) without derogating from any other obligations of                NICE hereunder as at such date to purchase Permitted Components,                NICE shall purchase from Contractor the additional Permitted                Components in Contractor's inventory, which are required, at                NICE' discretion, for manufacturing during the force majeure                period. The price and payment terms for purchase of such                Permitted Components shall be according to the provisions of                Section 3.4(A) above, which shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n                                       42\n\n          17.5.3. If the event of force majeure exists for more than 90 days,                each party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and                the provisions of Sections 16.2. and 16.3. regarding the notice                period required shall apply mutatis mutandis, and thereafter                Section 16 regarding effects of termination shall apply.\n\n     17.6. RELATIONSHIP. NICE and Contractor acknowledge and agree that this           Agreement shall not constitute, create or give effect to a joint           venture, pooling arrangement, principal/agency relationship,           partnership relationship or formal business organization of any kind           and neither Contractor and/or NICE shall have the right to bind the           other without the other's express prior written consent. Contractor           will render the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services as an independent           contractor and no employee - employer relationship shall exist between           Contractor and/or the Personnel and/or anyone on its behalf and NICE.\n\n     17.7. MANAGEMENT CHANGES. Contractor shall notify NICE immediately upon the           occurrence of any material change in the conduct of business of           Contractor or in the composition of its management, which has a\n\n\n\n\n\n          material adverse affect on Contractor's ability to perform this           Agreement.\n\n     17.8. WAIVER. The failure of either party to insist upon strict performance           of any provision of this Agreement, or the failure of either party to           exercise any right or remedy to which it is entitled hereunder, shall           not constitute a waiver thereof and shall not cause a diminution of           the obligations established by this Agreement. A waiver of any default           shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default. No waiver of           any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be effective unless it           is expressly stated to be a waiver and communicated to the other party           in writing in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n     17.9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this           Agreement or the breach, termination or validity thereof shall be           settled in accordance with one of the following procedures. Contractor           and NICE shall use the procedures in the following order of priority.\n\n                                       43\n\n          17.9.1. In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim of any kind                or nature arising under or in connection with this Agreement                (including but not limited to disputes as to the creation,                validity, interpretation, breach or termination of this                Agreement) (a \"DISPUTE\"), then upon the written notice of either                Party, the Dispute will be submitted to the project manager on                behalf of each party to be escalated, in case the parties are                unable to resolve such Dispute, to the parties C.E.O.'s\n\n          17.9.2.

Without derogating from rights of termination as detailed in                this Agreement, it is clarified that Contractor will continue to                provide the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services and NICE shall                continue to perform its obligations hereunder during any                litigation, mediation or legal proceedings commenced pursuant to                this Section 17.9. above and the existence of a Dispute shall not                enable Contractor to stop work or services or otherwise not                timely perform its obligations or enable NICE to stop payments or                otherwise not timely perform its obligations.\n\n          17.9.4. The foregoing shall not affect the right of the parties to                seek injunctions before the competent Court.\n\n     17.10. Wherever in this Agreement it is provided that the Parties agree to           negotiate/review/change any term hereof (including prices), the           parties will usetheir best commercial efforts and negotiate in good           faith in order to reach such agreement.

The parties will come to agreement with respect to Exhibit A as to whether prior written approval is needed in every instance or whether it is not needed after the first instance has been approved in writing (e.g., given exigencies in television production business, it is reasonable that Zynga would approve the use of its brand conceptually in elements of an episode but not need to re-approve the use in a similar manner for every episode the brand is used in; and similarly, given exigencies in the social gaming business, it is reasonable that WPT would approve use of its brand conceptually in elements of the Zynga platform but not need to re-approve the use in a similar manner for every poker tournament the brand is used in). i.

No approval may be unreasonably withdrawn by Licensor once delivered. iii. Zynga shall advise WPT to Zynga's knowledge as to which jurisdictions where it may be illegal to advertise Zynga's Licensed Property (if any) given local laws or regulations. iv.

Subcontractor and Manufacturer may also be referred to herein individually as \"Party\" or collectively as the \"Parties\". RECITALS WHEREAS, Subcontractor currently is the registered manufacturer of hearing aids and related components and accessories (the \"Zounds Products\") that are sold under the Subcontractor's brand names through various marketing and distribution channels. WHEREAS the Parties desire to enter an agreement whereby the Subcontractor as the Manufacturer's subcontractor will provide design, technology, manufacturing and supply chain services to the Manufacturer to enable the Manufacturer to manufacture comparable hearing aids and related components and accessories to be sold under Manufacturer's exclusive brand names (the \"Manufacturer's Products\") through the Manufacturer's various marketing and distribution channels. WHEREAS, the Parties also desire to enter into a lease agreement of Subcontractor's current Chandler, Arizona facility that provides the Manufacturer an FDA medical device facility for the Manufacturer's Products. WHEREAS, the Parties also desire to enter into an agreement that provides for the joint marketing and sale of each other's products. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and covenants contained herein, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 1. Term. Subject to earlier termination as provided in this Agreement, the initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period beginning on the Effective Date and ending ten (10) years thereafter unless this Agreement is terminated earlier as provided herein. This Agreement will renew automatically thereafter for successive one-year terms unless and until one Party gives notification of termination with at least sixty (60) days written notice. All orders placed under this Agreement must be placed prior to the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n2. Technology Access Fee. Manufacturer will pay Subcontractor One Million and No/100 USD ($1,000,000) (the \"Technology Access Fee\"). The Technology Access Fee will be paid in two equal installments of $500,000 each. The first installment will be due thirty (30) days following the Effective Date and the second installment will be due sixty (60) days following the Effective Date.\n\n3. Orders for Manufacturer's Products to be Manufactured by Subcontractor\n\n3.1 Purchase Orders: Excess Inventory. Manufacturer shall provide to Subcontractor a purchase order setting forth the proposed quantity of Manufacturer's Products to be purchased by Manufacturer and delivery dates, which purchase order will be subject to written acceptance by Subcontractor. All purchase orders are non-cancellable, and the Manufacturer shall pay for the purchaser orders as follows: (i) for purchase orders for less than or equal to a total of five hundred (500) units in any given calendar month, payment of fifty percent (50%) of Product Cost (as defined below) shall be made in full at the time the order is placed and the remaining balance paid in full before the Manufacturer's Products are shipped; and (ii) for purchase orders for more than five hundred (500) units in any given calendar month, payment of one hundred percent (100%) of Product Cost shall be made in full at the time the order is placed. Manufacturer's purchase orders accepted by Subcontractor and any forecast provided to Subcontractor by Manufacturer will constitute authorization for Subcontractor to procure product components to manufacture the Manufacturer's Products covered by such purchase orders based on their lead times. Subcontractor will advise Manufacturer of the lead time of components contained within their order and any forecast and Manufacturer will pay for the components prior to the Subcontractor placing orders for the components.\n\n3.2 Contract Formation: Acceptance and Entire Agreement. Each time Manufacturer submits an order for Manufacturer's Products and Subcontractor accepts the order or ships the ordered Manufacturer's Products to Manufacturer, a new contract is formed consisting of this Agreement, the quantities and delivery dates specified in the order and the prices then offered by Subcontractor. ACCEPTANCE OF MANUFACTURER'S ORDER IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENT MADE BY MANUFACTURER, AND DOES NOT IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF MANUFACTURER'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN ANY PURCHASE ORDER FORM, WHETHER PROVIDED BY MANUFACTURER OR SUBCONTRACTOR, WILL BECOME A PART OF THE CONTRACT AND THIS CONTRACT WILL GOVERN ALL PURCHASES. Manufacturer's acceptance of or payment for Manufacturer's Products that Manufacturer has not ordered creates a contract comprised of this Agreement, the quantities of Manufacturer's Products accepted or paid for, and the prices then offered by Subcontractor. This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement with respect to any contract formed and shall not be altered, amended, supplemented or canceled without the express written agreement of both Manufacturer and Subcontractor.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Product Prices. Pricing shall be the actual cost of the manufacturing of each Manufacturer's Product plus the proportional allocation of the costs of Subcontractor's manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain overhead, as mutually agreed by the Parties (the \"Product Cost\"). Title of the product will transfer to the Manufacturer at the shipping dock of the manufacturing facility. Manufacturer will be responsible for shipping costs. Manufacturer shall pay any taxes incurred in the manufacture of Manufacturer's Products, including any taxes incurred as a result of purchasing components or maintaining inventory. In addition to the Royalties paid under this Agreement to the Subcontractor, Manufacturer shall pay any other third-party royalties for technology that are required to manufacture the Manufacturer's Products for their intended purpose. As of the date of this Agreement neither Party is aware of any third-party royalties for technology that Manufacturer would be liable to pay. Subcontractor will provide Manufacturer with documentation substantiating any Product Cost variance upon request.\n\n3.4 Cost Reductions. Potential Product Cost reductions as a result of materials pricing will be reviewed and implemented periodically as mutually agreed and passed on to the Manufacturer. Product Cost reductions resulting from engineering changes or other changes, initiated by Manufacturer, that would impact either Product Costs or process changes at Subcontractor will be implemented at an agreed upon time. Manufacturer will be responsible for their proportionate share of any Product Cost reduction that is a result of engineering investment by the Subcontractor. If the Manufacturer does not pay its proportionate share, the Manufacturer will pay the Product Cost as if the cost reduction had not been made (i.e., the Product Cost prior to the cost reduction as if the cost reduction were not made). The Subcontractor will list the new Product Cost and a line item for engineering investment that accounts for the difference.\n\n3.5 Royalties. In addition to paying the Product Costs of Manufacturer's Products, Manufacturer shall also pay to Subcontractor the following royalty payments (each a \"Royalty\" and collectively the \"Royalties\") for each of Manufacturer's Product purchased under this Agreement. Royalties shall be paid 50% at time of shipping and the remaining balance of 50% due in 15-days after the Manufacturer's Products have shipped from the manufacturing facility. a) Non-Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer's Products that are non-rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay Subcontractor a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) eighty percent (80.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $80 per unit. b) Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer's Products that are rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay Subcontractor a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) one hundred percent (100.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $100 per unit. 3.6 Zounds' Products and Manufacturers Products Built to Manufacturer's Specifications. Subject to Section 7 below, Subcontractor agrees to manufacture Manufacturer's Products (i) that are identical to Zounds' Products allowing Manufacturer to utilize Subcontractor's existing product designs and features and/ or (ii) to specifications provided by Manufacturer from time to time with approval of such changes by Subcontractor. Any advice given by Subcontractor to Manufacturer before or after delivery of Products built to Manufacturer's specifications is based solely upon the information available to Subcontractor, and the use of such advice by Manufacturer is solely and entirely at Manufacturer's own risk. Manufacturer represents and warrants that it has independently determined the fitness, need, usefulness, and applicability of the Manufacturer's Products built to Manufacturer's specifications it has ordered and does not rely on any representation of Subcontractor in that regard.\n\n3.7 Engineering Services and Design Changes. Manufacturer may elect to utilize Subcontractor's design engineering resources (the \"Engineering and Design Services\") to further customize Manufacturer's Products. The cost of Engineering and Design Services to be paid by Manufacturer will be agreed to in a written document setting forth the scope, timing and other terms of such Engineering and Design Services executed by the Parties prior to any services being provided by Subcontractor. Subject to the written agreement of the parties with respect to any resulting change in price, delivery schedule and other terms, Subcontractor will accept design changes (i.e., Engineering Change Orders or \"ECO's\") according to Manufacturer's instructions.\n\n3.8 Tooling, Setup and Non-Recurring Engineering (\"NRE\") Charges. Subcontractor agrees to provide Manufacturer with a quote for any one-time tooling, setup or NRE charges payable by Manufacturer as a result of a change in design requested by Manufacturer, change in minimum quantity requirements by Manufacturer as originally quoted by Subcontractor, or an addition to the Manufacturer's Products purchased under this Agreement requested by Manufacturer. If Manufacturer elects to proceed with the design change, minimum quantity requirements change or addition as specified in Subcontractor's quote, Manufacturer will provide Subcontractor with written acceptance of Subcontractor's quoted terms.\n\n3.9 Inventory Reports. Subcontractor agrees to report its inventory position to Manufacturer on a monthly basis, including the following information: quantity of raw material, work in process and any open orders that cannot be cancelled to the supplier lead time. The report will specifically identify any material on hand or on order where the quantity exceeds the agreed three (3) month forward looking forecast plus safety stock as agreed upon by Subcontractor and Manufacturer. The Subcontractor and Manufacturer will review inventory levels and safety stocks quarterly.\n\n4. Delivery and Shipping. The agreed upon delivery dates are based on the Subcontractor's projected lead time, current inventory, commitments and Subcontractor's advice. Manufacturer agrees and acknowledges that all shipment dates are firm delivery dates. All shipments shall be F.O.B. the manufacturing facility unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing. The method and route of shipment shall be at Subcontractor's discretion, unless Manufacturer supplies instructions in writing at least five days prior to shipment. In addition to the purchase price, Manufacturer shall pay any and all transportation charges (including insurance). The risk of loss of and title to the Manufacturer's Products pass to Manufacturer upon the receipt of the Manufacturer's Products by the carrier. Subcontractor is not responsible for any installation of Manufacturer's Products sold\n\n\n\n\n\nhereunder or delays caused by Manufacturer-specified suppliers.\n\n5. Leased Space Agreement. Manufacturer will lease from Subcontractor a well-defined space for Manufacturer's Products within the Subcontractor's current FDA registered manufacturer's facility. Subcontractor is solely responsible for maintaining all aspects of such leased space including but not limited to; (i) segregation of Manufacturer's Products with all Manufacturer's Products clearly segregated and marked; and (ii) meeting all necessary requirements deemed appropriate by the FDA and any regulatory authorities for a medical device manufacturer's facility. Subcontractor will be also solely responsible for remaining in good standings at all times with all regulatory authorities including but not limited to the standards set forth by the FDA for medical device manufacturing facilities. The Manufacturer may list the address of the Subcontractor's current FDA registered manufacturer's facility as the Manufacturer's own FDA approved manufacturer's facility for the Manufacturer's Products. The terms of such lease agreement will be mutually agreed to by the Parties in a separate document.\n\n6. Payment Terms. Upon Subcontractor's approval and acceptance of a production forecast provided by Manufacturer, Manufacturer's payment for Manufacturer's Products will be due when forecasted materials or components must be ordered by the Subcontractor as set forth in Section 3 above. A schedule of the forecast payables will be provided by the Subcontractor to the Manufacturer based on the approved forecast. Components and products will only be procured and/or manufactured once payment has been received. All payments will be made by electronic wire transfer and all of the appropriate forms will need to be signed so that this can happen efficiently. Alternately, payments can be made to Subcontractor's address as shown Subcontractor's invoice. No offsets are allowed to be taken by either Party. Manufacturer represents that all sales to Manufacturer under this Agreement are sales for use in production or resale; therefore no sales, use, excise or other taxes are due as a result of such sales and Manufacturer will be responsible for payment of any such taxes. A copy of the Manufacturer's resale certificate will be provided by Manufacturer within 15-days of the Effective Date.\n\n7. Limited Warranty; Nonconforming Products. Since Manufacturer is paying the actual manufacturing cost of the product, Supplier has not reserved for any warranty related costs. The Manufacturer acknowledges that it is solely responsible for any warranty costs associated with Manufacturer's Products. Should any nonconformities be detected during or after the manufacturing process, Subcontractor will assist Manufacturer in resolving any quality issues with the suppliers. Subcontractor will provide support to Manufacturer to train Manufacturer's employees to repair the non-conforming products as appropriate. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will provide repair services for a fee equal to the actual cost of these services. In the event Manufacturer in good faith believes that Manufacturer's Products are nonconforming under the specifications agreed to among the Parties (the \"Standards\"), Manufacturer shall give written notice to Subcontractor specifying in detail the nonconformity within thirty (30) days of Manufacturer's receipt of such Manufacturer's Products. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will facilitate such Manufacturer's Products being repaired or replaced, Manufacturer must return the Manufacturer's Products to Subcontractor, transportation charges prepaid by Manufacturer, within fifteen (15) days of the end of such thirty (30) date notice period. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Subcontractor makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to: (i) any materials, components or subassemblies; (ii) defects resulting from the Specifications or the design of the Manufacturer's Products; (iii) Manufacturer's Product that has been abused, damaged, altered or misused by any person or entity after title passes to Manufacturer; (iv) first articles, prototypes, pre-production units, test units or other similar Manufacturer's Products; or (v) defects resulting from tooling, designs or instructions produced or supplied by Manufacturer. Manufacturer shall be liable for costs or expenses incurred by Subcontractor related to the foregoing exclusions to Subcontractor's express limited warranty. If Subcontractor determines that the Manufacturer's Products are nonconforming under the Standards, Subcontractor, shall work with their vendors to rework the Manufacturer's Products or otherwise replace the Manufacturer's Products. Manufacturer shall be liable for the cost of rework or replacement and all associated costs therewith including, without limitation, transportation charges and inspection fees. If requested by the Manufacturer, Subcontractor will provide a cause of failure, a failure analysis provided in Subcontractor's standard format and correction action.\n\n\n\n\n\nMANUFACTURER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUBCONTRACTOR IS NOT THE MANUFACTURER OF MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE MANUFACTURER'S PRODUCTS OR ANY THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER'S AGENT. SUBCONTRACTOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS THEREOF WHICH SUBCONTRACTOR DID NOT MANUFACTURE. FURTHER, SUBCONTRACTOR SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN FACT OR BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, CONTAINED IN OR DERIVED FROM THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ORDER, OR IN ANY OTHER MATERIALS, BROCHURES, PRESENTATIONS, SAMPLES, MODELS OR OTHER DOCUMENTATION OR COMMUNICATIONS WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONFORMANCE WITH THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER'S SPECIFICATIONS OR OTHERWISE, WHICH WOULD EXTEND BEYOND THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY CONTAINED HEREIN. SUBCONTRACTOR AUTHORIZES MANUFACTURER TO ASSERT AT MANUFACTURER'S EXPENSE FOR SUBCONTRACTOR'S ACCOUNT, ALL OF SUBCONTRACTOR'S RIGHTS UNDER ANY APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY, AND SUBCONTRACTOR AGREES TO COOPERATE WITH MANUFACTURER IN ASSERTING SUCH RIGHTS; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT MANUFACTURER WILL DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SUBCONTRACTOR HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY LOSS, LIABILITY OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES, RESULTING FROM OR ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION BY MANUFACTURER RELATING TO THE ABOVE AUTHORIZATION.

Term of Agreement; Resignation and Removal of Servicer.\n\n(a) This Agreement shall continue in force until the earlier to occur of (i) the Owner no longer owns any Receivables or Participation Interests, and (ii) subject to Section 7(d), the delivery of written notice of termination by the Owner to the Servicer pursuant to Section 7(c), in each case upon which event this Agreement shall automatically terminate unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Servicer and the Owner.\n\n(b) Subject to Section 7(d), the Servicer may resign its duties hereunder by providing the Owner with at least 60 days' prior written notice.\n\n(c) Subject to Section 7(d), and subject to the prior written consent of the Agent so long as the Loan Agreement remains outstanding, the Owner may remove the Servicer immediately upon written notice of termination from the Owner to the Servicer if any of the following events shall occur (each, a \"Servicer Termination Right - Owner\"):\n\n(i) the Servicer shall default in the performance of any of its duties under this Agreement and, after notice of such default, shall not cure such default within 30 days (or, if such default cannot be cured in such time, shall not give within 30 days such assurance of cure as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Owner); or\n\n(ii) the Servicer files or consents to the filing of any petition, either voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization statute, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or\n\n(iii) the Servicer fails to maintain, in any material respect, all necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction in which it is performing the primary servicing function for any of the Serviced Assets under this Agreement.\n\nThe Servicer agrees that if any of the events specified in clause (ii) of this Section 7(c) shall occur, it shall give written notice thereof to the Owner within seven (7) days after the occurrence of such event.\n\n(d) No termination, resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to this Section shall be effective until (i) a successor Servicer shall have been appointed by or on behalf of the Owner with the prior written consent of the Agent so long as the Loan Agreement remains outstanding, and (ii) such successor Servicer shall have agreed in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement in the same manner as the Servicer is bound hereunder.\n\n(e) Agent may terminate this Agreement upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement by delivery of written notice of termination from Agent to Owner and Servicer (a \"Servicer Termination Right - Agent\" and, together with the Servicer Termination Right - Owner, each a \"Servicer Termination Right\"):\n\nIf a successor Servicer does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Servicer resigns or is removed, the resigning or removed Servicer or the Owner may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Servicer.\n\nIn the event that the Servicer resigns or is terminated hereunder, the Servicer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to and shall cooperate with the Owner and take other reasonable steps requested by the Owner to assist in the orderly and efficient transfer of the administration of the Serviced Assets to the successor Servicer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 8. Action upon Termination, Resignation or Removal of the Servicer. Promptly upon the effective date of termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7, the Servicer shall be entitled to be paid all fees and reimbursable expenses, including any reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys' fees, accruing to it to the date of such termination, resignation or removal. The Servicer shall forthwith upon such termination pursuant to Section 7 deliver to the successor Servicer all property and documents of or relating to the Serviced Assets then in the custody of the Servicer, or if this Agreement has been terminated, to the Owner. In the event of the resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7, the Servicer shall cooperate with the Owner and take all reasonable steps requested to assist the Owner in making an orderly transfer of the duties of the Servicer.\n\nSection 9. Compensation. The Servicer will be entitled to receive the Servicing Fee for the performance of the duties and provision of the services called for in this Agreement in accordance with, and subject to, the Loan Agreement.

Any opinion, filing or other services performed by the Servicer hereunder that generates additional costs shall be at the expense of the Owner.\n\nSection 10. Sub-Servicers; Collection Agents.\n\n(a) The Servicer may appoint one or more Persons (including any Affiliate) as a sub-servicer (each a \"Sub-Servicer\") with respect to some or all of the Serviced Assets to perform any of the Servicer's obligations hereunder from time to time in its sole discretion; provided, however, that such servicing arrangement and the term of the related subservicing agreement (if any) must provide for the servicing of the Serviced Assets in a manner equivalent or greater than the Servicing Standard; provided, further, that the Servicer shall remain obligated and be liable to the Owner for the servicing and administering of the Serviced Assets in accordance with the provisions hereof without diminution of such obligation and liability by virtue of the appointment of such Sub-Servicer and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Serviced Assets.\n\n(b) The Servicer shall be entitled to terminate the subservicing of the Serviced Assets by any Sub-Servicer so appointed at any time in its sole discretion, provided, that any subservicing agreement entered into by Servicer with any such Sub-Servicer shall terminate by its terms no later than thirty (30) days after the Servicer is terminated as the servicer under this Agreement.\n\n(c) Each Sub-Servicer shall be entitled to compensation for its services as a Sub-Servicer as agreed to by the Servicer and such Sub-Servicer provided that any sub-servicing fees payable to the Sub-Servicer in respect of its servicing activities shall be payable out of the Servicing Fee.\n\n(d) Any subservicing arrangement that may be entered into and any other transactions or services relating to the Serviced Assets involving a Sub-Servicer in its capacity as such shall be deemed to be solely between the Sub-Servicer and the Servicer alone, and the Owner shall not be deemed party thereto and shall have no claims, rights, obligations, duties, or liabilities with respect to the Sub-Servicer in such capacity.\n\n(e) The Owner may, from time to time, enter into Collection Agency Agreements with Collection Agents for the collection of delinquent or defaulted accounts. Any such Collection Agent shall not be deemed a \"Sub-Servicer\" hereunder and the Servicer shall have no liability with respect to the acts or omissions of any such Collection Agent. Any Collection Fees shall be paid directly by the Owner in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall cooperate with the Owner and provide such assistance as is reasonably necessary to transfer servicing of applicable Serviced Assets to the related Collection Agent.\n\nSection 11.

Object of the Affiliate Program/ Affiliate Management Program for Software Publishers\n\nThe object of the Affiliate Program provided by element 5 (hereafter, \"Program\") is to publish electronic advertisements on the Web site of the Affiliate for selected software products offered by element 5 Software Publishers. Instead of fixed compensation, the Affiliate receives result- dependent Advertising Cost Compensation (also known in the element 5 Control Panel as \"Commission\") in exchange for publishing the advertisements. The Advertising Cost Compensation depends on the actual sales generated by end users referred via the electronic advertisement (the Affiliate's link).\n\nWithin the context of sales processed from this Program, element 5 acts (to the end user) as a service provider for Software Publisher and handles the sales process by proxy of Software Publisher in accordance with underlying share-it! Developer Agreement. element 5 receives an additional service fee from the participating Publishers for this Affiliate Management.\n\nUnder the terms of this Affiliate Management, \"Software Publisher's Control Panel\" shall mean the password protected secure interface on element 5's Web servers that allows the Software Publisher to gain access to Sales data and End User data through a secure online connection and change Software Publisher related settings, e.g. the commission of the Affiliate and activation and deactivation of the Affiliate.\n\n\"Affiliate's Control Panel\" shall mean the password protected secure interface on element 5's Web servers that allows the Affiliate to (i) gain access to referred sales through a secure online connection and (ii) change Affiliate related settings, e.g. input or alteration of personal data, definition of default style within the context of the given technical limitations, and requests for new partnerships with Software Publishers or termination of existing partnerships.\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Affiliate Program\n\n\u00a7 1 Affiliate Participation\n\nParticipation of an individual Affiliate in the Program is dependent on activation by the Software Publisher. Once the Affiliate has registered, element 5 will send an e-mail to Software Publisher with a request to activate the Affiliate. Once the Affiliate is activated by the Software Publisher, the Affiliate is considered to be a participant in this program and is bound by these General Terms and Conditions.\n\n\u00a7 2 Products under the Agreement\n\n(1) The Products under the Agreement are software products designated by the respective Software Publisher for this purpose and which can be selected by the Affiliate from a product catalog in the Affiliate Control Panel. (2) Following initial activation of a product under the agreement, the Affiliate has the opportunity to choose further software products (including those from other Software Publishers), found in the Affiliate's Control Panel, and offer them on the Affiliate's Web site under these General Terms and Conditions. However, the offering of these new products is dependent on the Software Publisher activating the Affiliate for the respective software.\n\n\u00a7 3 Control Panel\n\n(1) After successfully completing the registration process for participation in the Program, the Affiliate will be sent a user ID and a password to access to the \"Affiliate Control Panel\". With the user ID and password, the \"Affiliate Control Panel\" provides the Affiliate access, via a secure online connection, to a secure area on element 5's Web server so that the Affiliate may, at any time, view the number of software sales the Affiliate has referred, as well as change other settings. (2) When using the user ID and password, the Affiliate shall observe the following obligations and precautions: (i) Only the Affiliate may use the user ID and password. (ii) The password shall be kept strictly confidential. The Affiliate shall take due care to ensure that no unauthorized parties learn the password. (iii) If the Affiliate loses its password or if there is a possibility that an unauthorized party has learned the user ID and password, the Affiliate shall immediately report this to element 5, which can then block access by the Affiliate to the Control Panel. All actions carried out with the user ID and password will be attributed to the Affiliate.\n\n\u00a7 4 Integration of the Link\n\n(1) The Affiliate shall integrate the product under the agreement using the appropriate link on its Web site; the link points to the order form operated by element 5. This link is generated by a Link Generator for the respective product under the agreement. The Link\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerator is located in the secure area of element 5's Web site in the \"Affiliate Control Panel\". The link that is generated contains an individualized affiliate user ID by means of which any sales can be attributed to the Affiliate. Proper technical integration of the link is the responsibility of the Affiliate. If the links do not function, no Advertising Cost Compensation will be paid. (2) The Affiliate shall indicate on its Web site that (i) the Affiliate is acting as an independent partner of the respective Software Publisher by participation in the Affiliate Program provided by element 5 and (ii) The Software Publisher is the seller of the product and the payment process is administered by element 5. (3) The Affiliate shall produce a brief description for each activated product on its Web site. The Affiliate is responsible for the content, the style and the layout of this information. The Software Publisher can provide the Affiliate with graphics and text in an electronic format for use in describing the product, which the Affiliate shall use for the purpose of advertising the Products under the Agreement and links according to the instructions of the Software Publisher. The Affiliate should be aware that the product prices and availability may change at any time. It is not recommended that the price be listed on the Web site of the Affiliate. Maintenance of these product prices is possible only on the Web sites of the Software Publisher and the Publisher's corresponding site operated by element 5.\n\n\u00a7 5 Order Processing\n\n(1) element 5 shall be responsible for the entire order processing for the referred end user according to the terms and conditions of the underlying share-it! Developer Agreement between the Software Publisher and element 5. element 5 shall provide the order forms for the order processing on its Web server; receive payments from the referred end users and forward these payments, less the agreed Advertising Cost Compensation, the service fees and relevant value added tax (VAT) to the Software Publisher; handle refunds and returns according to the provisions of the underlying share-it! Developer Agreement; and provide end user service relating to the administration of the order. The Software Publisher shall provide technical end-user service. (2) element 5 reserves the right to reject queries and orders which do not meet its requirements; including, in particular, orders by referred end users who do not meet credit requirements, who do not authorize direct debiting from their bank account, or who do not present a valid credit card. (3) An agreement by the Software Publisher with the referred end user does not exist until either a written or electronic order confirmation arrives from element 5 in the name of the Software Publisher or when element 5 begins to fulfill the agreement in the name of the Software Publisher. Typographical, printing and computation errors on the Web site of the Affiliate shall be charged to said Affiliate.\n\n\u00a7 6 Advertising Cost Compensation\n\n(1) element 5 will pay Affiliate its advertising costs (including Vat, if any, on presentation of a valid VAT invoice) if an end user arrives via the link integrated in Affiliate's Web site at the order page hosted by element 5 for the respective Software\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nPublisher's Product under this Agreement and end user uses the automatic ordering system that carries out the registration and payment processing, so that the Affiliate's link is deemed to be directly causative for the entry of the End User into the agreement with the Software Publisher and End User's payment, proving that all requirements are irrevocably met (\"agreements arising in a qualified manner\"). Affiliate is only eligible to earn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales occurring during the term of this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned. (2) Insofar as the referred end user accepts cookies when clicking on Affiliate's link, proceeds from orders will be taken into account which do arise within the lifespan (of max. 180 days) of the cookie(s) used and/ or possibly within the lifespan of a special action of the Software Publisher via integrated link. (3) element 5 shall record and compute on a monthly basis the amount of said Advertising Cost Compensation for the Affiliate. (4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost Compensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user. The percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be stipulated by the Software Publisher, but shall not exceed 50% of the effective gross sales price of the software. (5) The Advertising Cost Compensation shall not be paid if and insofar as it is determined that the end user will not meet its payment obligations or will meet them only partially, or if for any other reason the invoice to the end user was cancelled (e.g. in cases where a charge back of a credit card charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software product occurs). If the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid by element 5, it can be offset or invoiced to Affiliate at element 5's own discretion. (6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly insofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program. (7) The payment can be made by wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only) or check, as chosen by the Affiliate. (8) The invoicing is deemed to be approved if the Affiliate does not object in writing, including a statement of reasons, within four weeks.\n\nIII. Affiliate Management for Software Publishers\n\n\u00a7 1 Participation by the Software Publisher\n\n(1) Software Publisher's participation in Affiliate Management indicates that the Software Publisher agrees to these General Terms and Conditions, and that the Software Publisher shall integrate the Affiliate Program into the Web site using a corresponding link. (2) To generate revenue through this Program by means of sales referred by the Affiliate, the Affiliate, after completion of registration, must be activated by the Software Publisher in the Control Panel. The Software Publisher will be informed of the Affiliate's\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nregistration per e-mail with a request for the Affiliate's activation from element 5. (3) By configuring the settings in the Control Panel, the Software Publisher determines the amount of the success-based Advertising Cost Compensation. If the Publisher does not configure any settings, then it will accept the default settings proposed by element 5 when activating the Affiliate. Prior to making changes in the Control Panel regarding the amount of the Advertising Cost Compensation, written notification must be given to element 5 and the Affiliate.\n\n\u00a7 2 Integration of the link\n\n(1) element 5 shall make a hyperlink available to the Software Publisher that links to the appropriate registration form for the Affiliate Program. The link can be accessed in the secure \"Software Publisher Control Panel\" on element 5's Web site under \"Affiliate Management\". (2) Every Affiliate must complete the registration form once prior to participating in the Program and agree to these General Terms and Conditions by checking the Online checkbox. Afterwards, the Affiliate can also advertise other Products under this Agreement (see above \u00a7 3) after activation by the respective Software Publisher.\n\n\u00a7 3 element 5's Service Fee\n\nFor each sale administered by element 5 of the Software under this Agreement, element 5 shall receive an additional service fee of 2% of the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) as well as the Advertising Cost Compensation defined in II. \u00a7 6 (4) and in addition to VAT or sales tax (where applicable). element 5 will pay the Affiliate the Advertising Cost Compensation as defined in II. \u00a7 6 . Further invoicing terms are obtained from the existing business relationship, defined in the respective share-it! Developer Agreement between Software Publisher and element 5.\n\nIV. General terms\n\n\u00a7 1 License\n\nUpon activation of the Affiliate, the Software Publisher grants the Affiliate a non-exclusive, revocable right to use provided advertising material, notices and all further presentations (insofar as available - also known hereafter as \"Material\") only for the purpose of designating its Web site as a \"partner Web site\" and presenting the designated advertising Material.

WHITHIN 14 DAYS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHANGED PARTICIPATION TERMS, AFFILIATE AND SOFTWARE PUBLISHER MAY OBJECT TO SUCH CHANGES.

Qualifying dates are always agreed as \"Receipt by Recipient\", unless otherwise noted.

Moreover, element 5 does not guarantee the Affiliate that the operation of its Web sites will be maintained without interruptions and without errors.
