You are evaluating the quality of information extracted from a contract document. The extraction task required identifying 41 specific categories of contract information including document details, party information, dates, legal clauses, and various contractual terms.

Review the original contract document and the extracted information, then answer the following questions:

1. COMPLETENESS: Did the extraction identify all relevant information for each of the 41 categories that are actually present in the document? Pay special attention to:
   - Were all parties to the contract correctly identified?
   - Were all critical dates (agreement, effective, expiration) accurately extracted?
   - Were all restrictive clauses (non-compete, exclusivity, etc.) properly identified with their complete scope?
   - Were all IP-related provisions completely captured, including license grants and ownership details?

2. ACCURACY & FORMAT: For the information that was extracted:
   - Is each extracted text span directly quoted from the document rather than paraphrased?
   - For categories with multiple instances (e.g., multiple parties), were they properly formatted as comma-separated lists?
   - Are empty strings correctly used only when information is truly absent from the document?
   - Are there any misclassifications where information was placed in the wrong category?

Based on your assessment, provide a score from 1-5 for both completeness and accuracy, with specific examples of any missed information or errors found.
