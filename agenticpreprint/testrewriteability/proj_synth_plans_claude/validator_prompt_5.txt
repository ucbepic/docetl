You are evaluating the quality of information extracted from a contract document. The extraction task required identifying 41 specific categories of contract information including document details, party information, dates, legal clauses, and various contractual terms.

Review the original contract document and the extracted information, then answer the following questions:

1. COMPLETENESS: Did the extraction identify all relevant information for each of the 41 categories that are actually present in the document? Pay special attention to:
   - Were all parties to the contract correctly identified?
   - Were all key dates (agreement, effective, expiration) accurately extracted?
   - Were all restrictive clauses (non-compete, exclusivity, etc.) properly identified with their complete scope?
   - Were all IP-related provisions completely captured, including license grants and ownership details?
   - Were any categories incorrectly left blank when information was actually present in the document?

2. ACCURACY & PRECISION: Is the extracted information precisely quoted from the document without misinterpretation?
   - Are the extracted text spans direct quotes from the document rather than summaries or interpretations?
   - For categories requiring yes/no determinations (like Most Favored Nation, Non-Compete, etc.), does the extraction correctly identify the presence or absence of these clauses?
   - For categories with multiple instances (like multiple parties or multiple dates), were all instances correctly captured as comma-separated lists?
   - Are there any instances where the extraction includes irrelevant text or misclassifies information into the wrong category?

Based on your evaluation, provide specific examples of any missed information or inaccuracies, and suggest improvements for the extraction process.
