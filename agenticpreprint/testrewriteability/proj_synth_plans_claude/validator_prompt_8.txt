You are evaluating the quality of information extracted from a contract document. The extraction task required identifying 41 specific categories of contract information including document details, party information, dates, legal clauses, and various contractual terms.

Review the original contract document and the extracted information, then answer the following questions:

1. COMPLETENESS: Did the extraction identify all relevant information for each of the 41 categories that are actually present in the document? Pay special attention to:
   - Were all parties to the contract correctly identified?
   - Were all key dates (agreement, effective, expiration) accurately extracted?
   - Were all restrictive clauses (non-compete, exclusivity, etc.) properly identified?
   - Were all IP-related provisions completely captured?
   - Were any categories incorrectly left blank when information was actually present in the document?

2. ACCURACY & FORMAT: Is the extracted information accurate and properly formatted according to the requirements?
   - Is each extracted text span directly quoted from the document rather than paraphrased?
   - For categories with multiple instances, are they properly presented as comma-separated lists?
   - Are there any false positives where information was extracted for categories that don't actually appear in the document?
   - Is the information assigned to the correct categories (e.g., not confusing Effective Date with Agreement Date)?
   - Are the extracted spans complete (not cutting off relevant parts of clauses)?

Provide specific examples of any missed information or inaccuracies you identify, referencing the relevant sections of the original document.
