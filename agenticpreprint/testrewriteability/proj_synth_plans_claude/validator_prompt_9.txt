You are evaluating the quality of information extraction from a contract document. The original task was to extract text spans for 41 specific legal categories from a contract document, including document name, parties, dates, and various legal clauses.

Review the original contract document and the extracted information, then answer the following questions:

1. COMPLETENESS: Did the extraction identify all relevant information for each of the 41 categories that are present in the document? Pay special attention to categories that typically appear in contracts (such as parties, dates, governing law, termination clauses, etc.). Are there any categories where information exists in the document but was missed in the extraction?

2. ACCURACY: For the categories where information was extracted, is the information accurate and properly formatted? Check specifically:
   a. Are text spans extracted verbatim from the document rather than paraphrased?
   b. For categories requiring comma-separated lists (when multiple instances exist), is this format followed correctly?
   c. Are empty strings properly used for categories not present in the document?
   d. Are there any instances where information was incorrectly categorized (e.g., effective date confused with agreement date)?

Provide specific examples of any errors or omissions you identify, referencing the category number and the text from the original document.
