      SEARCH THROUGH ALL CONTENT OF THE articles.

       I want you to provide me the
      names of the fruit/vegetable name which appeared the most amount of times and give me the amount of times it appeared.

      Also, provide me the list of all fruits and vegetables, and the count of the amount of times each appeared through all batches.

      Only count the fruit if you see the NAME of it, not a reference to it.
