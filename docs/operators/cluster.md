# Cluster operation

The Cluster operation in DocETL groups all items into a binary tree
using [agglomerative
clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Agglomerative_clustering_example)
of the embedding of some keys, and annotates each item with the path
through this tree down to the item (Note that the path is reversed,
starting with the most specific grouping, and ending in the root of
the tree, the cluster that encompasses all your input).

Each cluster is summarized using an llm prompt, taking the summaries
of its children as inputs (or for the leaf nodes, the actual items).

## ðŸš€ Example: Grouping concepts from a knowledge-graph

```yaml
- name: cluster_concepts
  type: cluster
  max_batch_size: 5
  embedding_keys:
    - concept
    - description
  output_key: categories # This is optional, and defaults to "clusters"
  summary_schema:
    concept: str
    description: str
  summary_prompt: |
    The following describes two related concepts. What concept
    encompasses both? Try not to be too broad; it might be that one of
    these two concepts already encompasses the other; in that case,
    you should just use that concept.

    {% for input in inputs %}
    {{input.concept}}:
    {{input.description}}
    {% endfor %}

    Provide the title of the super-concept, and a description.
```

This cluster operation processes a set of concepts, each with a title
and a description, and groups them into a tree of categories.

        "concept": "Shed",
        "description": "A shed is typically a simple, single-story roofed structure, often used for storage, for hobbies, or as a workshop, and typically serving as outbuilding, such as in a back garden or on an allotment. Sheds vary considerably in their size and complexity of construction, from simple open-sided ones designed to cover bicycles or garden items to large wood-framed structures with shingled roofs, windows, and electrical outlets. Sheds used on farms or in the industry can be large structures. The main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (the roof may be asphalt shingled or sheathed in tin), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Small sheds may include a wooden or plastic floor, while more permanent ones may be built on a concrete pad or foundation. Sheds may be lockable to deter theft or entry by children, domestic animals, wildlife, etc."

        "description": "A barn is an agricultural building usually on farms and used for various purposes. In North America, a barn refers to structures that house livestock, including cattle and horses, as well as equipment and fodder, and often grain.[2] As a result, the term barn is often qualified e.g. tobacco barn, dairy barn, cow house, sheep barn, potato barn. In the British Isles, the term barn is restricted mainly to storage structures for unthreshed cereals and fodder, the terms byre or shippon being applied to cow shelters, whereas horses are kept in buildings known as stables.[2][3] In mainland Europe, however, barns were often part of integrated structures known as byre-dwellings (or housebarns in US literature). In addition, barns may be used for equipment storage, as a covered workplace, and for activities such as threshing."

      {
        "concept": "Tree house",
        "description": "A tree house, tree fort or treeshed, is a platform or building constructed around, next to or among the trunk or branches of one or more mature trees while above ground level. Tree houses can be used for recreation, work space, habitation, a hangout space and observation. People occasionally connect ladders or staircases to get up to the platforms."

        "concept": "Castle",
        "description": "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders. Scholars usually consider a castle to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a mansion, palace, and villa, whose main purpose was exclusively for pleasance and are not primarily fortresses but may be fortified.[a] Use of the term has varied over time and, sometimes, has also been applied to structures such as hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes built to resemble castles. Over the Middle Ages, when genuine castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace."
      },
      {
        "concept": "Fortress",
        "description": "A fortification (also called a fort, fortress, fastness, or stronghold) is a military construction designed for the defense of territories in warfare, and is used to establish rule in a region during peacetime. The term is derived from Latin fortis ('strong') and facere ('to make'). From very early history to modern times, defensive walls have often been necessary for cities to survive in an ever-changing world of invasion and conquest. Some settlements in the Indus Valley Civilization were the first small cities to be fortified. In ancient Greece, large stone walls had been built in Mycenaean Greece, such as the ancient site of Mycenae (known for the huge stone blocks of its 'cyclopean' walls). A Greek phrourion was a fortified collection of buildings used as a military garrison, and is the equivalent of the Roman castellum or fortress. These constructions mainly served the purpose of a watch tower, to guard certain roads, passes, and borders. Though smaller than a real fortress, they acted as a border guard rather than a real strongpoint to watch and maintain the border."

## Required Parameters

- `name`: A unique name for the operation.
- `type`: Must be set to "cluster".
- `embedding_keys`: A list of keys to use for the embedding that is clustered on
- `summary_prompt`: The prompt used to summarize a cluster based on its children. Access input variables by iterating over `inputs` with `{% for input in inputs %}` and accessing properties with `{{input.keyname}}`.
- `summary_schema`: The schema for the summary of each cluster. This is the output schema for the `summary_prompt` based llm call.
