# Map Operation

The Map operation in DocETL applies a specified transformation to each item in your input data, allowing for complex processing and insight extraction from large, unstructured documents.

## ðŸš€ Example: Analyzing Long-Form News Articles

Let's see a practical example of using the Map operation to analyze long-form news articles, extracting key information and generating insights.

```yaml
- name: analyze_news_article
  type: map
  prompt: |
    Analyze the following news article:
    "{{ input.article }}"

    Provide the following information:
    1. Main topic (1-3 words)
    2. Summary (2-3 sentences)
    3. Key entities mentioned (list up to 5, with brief descriptions)
    4. Sentiment towards the main topic (positive, negative, or neutral)
    5. Potential biases or slants in reporting (if any)
    6. Relevant categories (e.g., politics, technology, environment; list up to 3)
    7. Credibility score (1-10, where 10 is highly credible)

  output:
    schema:
      main_topic: string
      summary: string
      key_entities: list[object]
      sentiment: string
      biases: list[string]
      categories: list[string]
      credibility_score: integer

  model: gpt-4o-mini
  validate:
    - len(output["main_topic"].split()) <= 3
    - len(output["key_entities"]) <= 5
    - output["sentiment"] in ["positive", "negative", "neutral"]
    - len(output["categories"]) <= 3
    - 1 <= output["credibility_score"] <= 10
  num_retries_on_validate_failure: 2
```

This Map operation processes long-form news articles to extract valuable insights:

1. Identifies the main topic of the article.
2. Generates a concise summary.
3. Extracts key entities (people, organizations, locations) mentioned in the article.
4. Analyzes the overall sentiment towards the main topic.
5. Identifies potential biases or slants in the reporting.
6. Categorizes the article into relevant topics.
7. Assigns a credibility score based on the content and sources.

The operation includes validation to ensure the output meets our expectations and will retry up to 2 times if validation fails.

??? example "Sample Input and Output"

    Input:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "article": "In a groundbreaking move, the European Union announced yesterday a comprehensive plan to transition all member states to 100% renewable energy by 2050. The ambitious proposal, dubbed 'Green Europe 2050', aims to completely phase out fossil fuels and nuclear power across the continent.

        European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated, 'This is not just about fighting climate change; it's about securing Europe's energy independence and economic future.' The plan includes massive investments in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, as well as significant funding for research into new energy storage technologies.

        However, the proposal has faced criticism from several quarters. Some Eastern European countries, particularly Poland and Hungary, argue that the timeline is too aggressive and could damage their economies, which are still heavily reliant on coal. Industry groups have also expressed concern about the potential for job losses in the fossil fuel sector.

        Environmental groups have largely praised the initiative, with Greenpeace calling it 'a beacon of hope in the fight against climate change.' However, some activists argue that the 2050 target is not soon enough, given the urgency of the climate crisis.

        The plan also includes provisions for a 'just transition,' with billions of euros allocated to retraining workers and supporting regions that will be most affected by the shift away from fossil fuels. Additionally, it proposes stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings and appliances, and significant investments in public transportation and electric vehicle infrastructure.

        Experts are divided on the feasibility of the plan. Dr. Maria Schmidt, an energy policy researcher at the University of Berlin, says, 'While ambitious, this plan is achievable with the right political will and technological advancements.' However, Dr. John Smith from the London School of Economics warns, 'The costs and logistical challenges of such a rapid transition should not be underestimated.'

        As the proposal moves forward for debate in the European Parliament, it's clear that 'Green Europe 2050' will be a defining issue for the continent in the coming years, with far-reaching implications for Europe's economy, environment, and global leadership in climate action."

!!! info "Validation and Gleaning"

    For more details on validation techniques and implementation, see [operators](../concepts/operators.md#validation).

### Batch Processing

The Map operation supports processing multiple documents in a single prompt using the `batch_prompt` parameter. This can be more efficient than processing documents individually, especially for simpler tasks and shorter documents, especially when there are LLM call limits. However, larger batch sizes (even > 5) can lead to more incorrect results, so use this feature judiciously.

??? example "Batch Processing Example"

    ```yaml
    - name: classify_documents
      type: map
      max_batch_size: 5  # Process up to 5 documents in a single LLM call
      batch_prompt: |
        Classify each of the following documents into categories (technology, business, or science):
        
        {% for doc in inputs %}
        Document {{loop.index}}:
        {{doc.text}}
        {% endfor %}
        
        Provide a classification for each document.
      prompt: |
        Classify the following document:
        {{input.text}}
      output:
        schema:
          category: string
    ```

When using batch processing:

1. The `batch_prompt` template receives an `inputs` list containing the batch of documents
2. Use `max_batch_size` to control how many documents are processed in each batch
3. You must also provide a `prompt` parameter that will be used in case the batch prompt's response cannot be parsed into the output schema
4. Gleaning and validation are applied to each document in the batch individually, after the batch has been processed by the LLM

!!! tip "Batch Size Considerations"

    Choose your `max_batch_size` carefully:
    
    - Larger batches may be more efficient but risk hitting token limits
    - Start with smaller batches (3-5 documents) and adjust based on your needs
    - Consider document length when setting batch size

## Advanced Features

### Tool Use

Tools can extend the capabilities of the Map operation. Each tool is a Python function that can be called by the LLM during execution, and follows the [OpenAI Function Calling API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).

??? example "Tool Definition Example"

    ```yaml
    tools:
    - required: true
        code: |
        def count_words(text):
            return {"word_count": len(text.split())}
        function:
        name: count_words
        description: Count the number of words in a text string.
        parameters:
            type: object
            properties:
            text:
                type: string
            required:
            - text
    ```

!!! warning

    Tool use and gleaning cannot be used simultaneously.

### Input Truncation

If the input doesn't fit within the token limit, DocETL automatically truncates tokens from the middle of the input data, preserving the beginning and end which often contain more important context. A warning is displayed when truncation occurs.

### Batching

If you have a really large collection of documents and you don't want to run them through the Map operation at the same time, you can use the `batch_size` parameter to process data in smaller chunks. This can significantly reduce memory usage and improve performance.

To enable batching in your map operations, you need to specify the `max_batch_size` parameter in your configuration.

```yaml
- name: extract_summaries
  type: map
  max_batch_size: 5
  clustering_method: random
  prompt: |
    Summarize this text: "{{ input.text }}"
  output:
    schema:
      summary: string
```

In the above config, there will be no more than 5 API calls to the LLM at a time (i.e., 5 documents processed at a time, one per API call).

### Dropping Keys

You can use a map operation to act as an LLM no-op, and just drop any key-value pairs you don't want to save to the output file. To do this, you can use the `drop_keys` parameter.

```yaml
- name: drop_keys_example
  type: map
  drop_keys:
    - "keyname1"
    - "keyname2"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Prompts**: Write clear, specific prompts that guide the LLM to produce the desired output.
2. **Robust Validation**: Use validation to ensure output quality and consistency.
3. **Appropriate Model Selection**: Choose the right model for your task, balancing performance and cost.
4. **Optimize for Scale**: For large datasets, consider using `sample` to test your operation before running on the full dataset.
5. **Use Tools Wisely**: Leverage tools for complex calculations or operations that the LLM might struggle with. You can write any Python code in the tools, so you can even use tools to call other APIs or search the internet.
